A few hundreds of such peptides have been experimentally found but experimental testing of all candidates is currently not feasible. Here we propose an original machine learning method for classification of aminoacid sequences, based on discovering a segment with a discriminative pattern of site-specific co-occurrences between sequence elements. The pattern is based on the positions of residues with correlated occurrence over a sliding window of a specified length. The algorithm first recognizes the most relevant training segment in each positive training instance. Then the classification is based on maximal distances between co-occurrence matrix of the relevant segments in positive training sequences and the matrix from negative training segments. The method was applied for studying sequences of aminoacids with regard to their amyloidogenic properties.Our method was first trained on available datasets of hexapeptides with the amyloidogenic classification, using 5 or 6-residue sliding windows. Depending on the choice of training and testing datasets, the area under ROC curve obtained the value up to 0.80 for experimental, and 0.95 for computationally generated (with 3D profile method) datasets. Importantly, the results on 5-residue segments were not significantly worse, although the classification required that algorithm first recognized the most relevant training segments.

It is well known that the mitotic spindle is a multi-component macromolecular machine composed of microtubules, molecular motors (kinesins, cytoplasmic dynein), and other regulatory molecules (microtubule-associated proteins, kinases, etc.). In recent years, most of the protein components of the mitotic spindle have been identified and the functions of these proteins have been characterized using molecular perturbations2,3. Thus, the mechanisms for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation are being revealed rapidly.

Recent advances in the controlled mechanical perturbation have indicated that the mitotic spindle possesses a structural pliability, size adaptability to the applied external forces, and a strong self-organizing ability.

Previously, it was demonstrated that the p66shc genome knockout significantly extends maximal lifespan in mice. P66shc could translocate into the mitochondria and increase intracellular ROS level, although basic mechanisms of this activity remain poorly understood. P66shc seems to play a significant role in carcinogenesis since an increased expression of p66shc correlates with poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma. In our study, we applied RNA interference using lentiviral constructions that express short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against the N-terminal CH2 domain of the p66shc isoform. As a consequence, the p66shc but not p52shc and p46shc isoforms was selectelively suppressed in the RKO colon carcinoma cell line. We found that RKO cells with p66shc knockdown have been shown to be more resistant to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure or serum starvation.

Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups; group 1 received phosphate buffer saline as the negative control, group 2 was injected with NMDA (160\u00a0nM) to induce retinal excitotoxic injury, and group 3 was pre-treated with PhTX-343 (160\u00a0nM) 24\u00a0h before NMDA exposure.

Treatment with 10 mg/kg Z-VAD-fmk or diluted DMSO (0.25 ml/kg) for 15 min before but not 2.5 h after AAP prevented the oxidant stress (hepatic glutathione disulfide content; nitrotyrosine staining), DNA fragmentation (anti-histone ELISA, TUNEL assay) and liver injury (plasma ALT activities) at 6 h after administration of 300 mg/kg AAP. Even a lower dose (0.1 ml/kg) of DMSO was partially effective. DMSO pretreatment also attenuated the initial decline in hepatic glutathione levels. On the other hand, 10 microM Z-VAD-fmk was unable to prevent AAP-induced cell death in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. We conclude that Z-VAD-fmk does not protect against AAP-induced liver injury and, therefore, caspases are not involved in the mechanism of AAP-induced liver injury. In contrast, the protection in vivo is caused by the diluted DMSO, which is used to solubilize the inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk.

A population wise analysis of responsiveness towards colorectal cancer is carried out with genetic, epigenetic, metagenomic and environmental factors associated with APC mutation mainly responsible for CRC among eight different populations.  Methods and Material:  The APC mutation has been obtained using the \u2018human gene mutation database-HGMD\u2019 and the \u2018international cancer genome consortium-ICGC\u2019 Data Portal. The epigenetic factors affecting colon cancer have been identified through EpiGRAPH tool.

Results:  Variants of APC gene from the selected ethnic classes chosen from Argentina, France, Germany, India, Poland, Romania, UK and USA were characterized, where the chromosome positions 112102966- 112177228 are found to be affected.

High-performance liquid chromatographic assays were used to quantitate unchanged antibiotic in plasma and urine. Serum bactericidal activities were determined against six clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using a modified microdilution method of Reller and Stratton (L. B. Reller and C. W. Stratton, J. Infect. Dis. 136:196-204, 1977). Overall, cefpirome exhibited pharmacokinetics similar to those of ceftazidime: half-life (t1/2), 1.95 h; concentration at 1 h (C1h), 47 to 49 micrograms/ml for both antibiotics. Ceftriaxone displayed the longest t1/2 (7.65 h) and the highest C1h (137.8 micrograms/ml), while we observed the shortest t1/2 (1.05 h) and the lowest C1h (19.85 micrograms/ml) with imipenem. At 1 h, cefpirome and, even more so, imipenem showed significantly better serum bactericidal activities against S. aureus (1:273 and 1:80) than did the other antibiotics (P less than 0.0005; analysis of variance with randomized block design and Bonferroni correction). Against E. cloacae, we observed the highest serum bactericidal titers at 1 h with cefpirome, and this superiority vis-\u00e0-vis the other antibiotics tested was maintained for up to 8 h after dosing. Ceftazidime remained the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa (serum bactericidal activity titers, 1:43 at 1 h) up to 8 h. In summary, the study showed that cefpirome and imipenem provide more potent serum bactericidal activities than do broad-spectrum cephalosporins against S. aureus; thus, both of these antibiotics should be adequate against serious S. aureus infections.

Due to the selectivity of masitinib for these pathways, this drug is under investigation for treating neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory disorders, as well as pancreatic and prostate cancer. Hepatotoxicity has been observed in some patients taking masitinib during clinical trials and is thought to arise from reactive metabolites formed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the liver.

Masitinib (2 \u03bcM) was incubated with pooled human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of NADPH. Potassium cyanide was added to trap reactive metabolites as cyano adducts. Metabolites were analyzed using reversed\u2010phase liquid chromatography \u2010 tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS).

Cefoxitin was only slightly active against such strains. The effect of a standard concentration of each agent on bacterial cultures during their growth phase was measured in the Jouan biophotometer. The beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins had a permanent bactericidal effect on the enzyme-producing reference strain, although the latent period varied considerably in some cases.

The objective of the present study is to investigate the protective function of FML on high glucose-induced cellular senescence in HRECs. The in vitro injury model was established by stimulating HRECs with 30\u00a0mm glucose. After evaluating the cytotoxicity of FML in HRECs, 0.05% and 0.1% FML were used as the optimal concentration in the entire experiment. It was found that the excessive released inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in HRECs induced by high glucose were significantly suppressed by FML, accompanied by the inhibitory effects on the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tissue factor (TF). Declined telomerase activity and enhanced senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity were found in high glucose-challenged HRECs, which were dramatically alleviated by FML, accompanied by the inactivation of the p53/p21 and retinoblastoma (Rb) signaling. Interestingly, FML ameliorated high glucose-induced dephosphorylation of Akt. Lastly, the protective effects of FML against high glucose-induced cellular senescence in HRECs were abolished by the co-treatment of the PI3K/Akt signaling inhibitor LY294002, suggesting the involvement of this pathway.

In this model, increasing pathogen transmission or policy stringency can trigger social tipping points in collective mask wearing.

The IRF2BP2 protein is found in different organisms and has been described as ubiquitously expressed in normal and tumor cells and tissues, indicating a possible role for this transcriptional cofactor in different cell signaling pathways. Recent data suggest the involvement of IRF2BP2 in the regulation of several cellular functions, such as the cell cycle, cell death, angiogenesis, inflammation and immune response, thereby contributing to physiological cell homeostasis. However, an imbalance in IRF2BP2 function may be related to the pathophysiology of cancer.

It has been demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro studies, that leptin increases glucose and fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle. These direct leptin effects are supported by the presence of the long form of the leptin receptor, considered to be capable of performing intracellular signaling, in peripheral tissues, including skeletal muscle. The exposure of soleus muscle to supra-physiological leptin concentrations stimulate the activity of both the pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and Krebs cycle. This could be due to a direct stimulation of PDH and krebs cycle by leptin or a consequence of an indirect effect of this hormone activating the mitochondrial uncoupling process. In addition, in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, leptin and insulin had opposite effects on lipid metabolism, with leptin favoring lipid oxidation and insulin favoring lipid storage as triglycerides (TG). The leptin effects on free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation were more pronounced in soleus than in EDL. The differences in response of soleus compared with that of EDL was probably due to differences in fiber type composition and metabolic characteristics. It has been demonstrated that leptin reduces the TG content of skeletal. When tissue TG content is severely depleted by hyperleptinemia in normal rats, there is a dramatic increase in insulin sensitivity. This lipopenic effect of leptin may protect from the development of insulin resistance and diabetes in animals. In humans, obesity is also associated with an increase in insulin resistance and the development of Type II diabetes, however, contrary to rats and mice, there is abundance of leptin, indicating a state of resistance to this hormone in humans. Future studies are necessary to investigate the reasons why lean subjects seem to respond properly to endogenous leptin while obese ones don't.

We have previously reported that STY4874, an efflux transporter of Salmonella serotype Typhi, exhibited promising characteristics as MDR pump. In this study, we aimed to get an insight into possible STY4874 inhibitors of plant origin. STY4874 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and extracts from pomegranate peel, milk thistle seeds and reserpine, a synthetic plant alkaloid, were screened for inhibition of ciprofloxacin efflux. The extracts of milk thistle seeds and reserpine when incubated with ciprofloxacin showed statistically significant STY4874-mediated inhibitory activity, rendering the efflux pump inactive and hence early growth inhibition of host cells compared with cells expressing efflux pump and incubated only with ciprofloxacin. This efflux pump inhibitory activity was further confirmed by time-kill experiments. This study is the first to report on efflux pump inhibition of S.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Understanding and combating resistance governed by multidrug efflux transporters is an ongoing research intensive area, affecting treatment of various nosocomial and endemic/epidemic infections. Confronting drug resistance requires that inhibitors debilitating the underlying mechanisms should be included in combination therapy. One such example is the prescription of clavulanic acid as combination therapy with amoxicillin, collectively called as co-amoxiclav to combat \u03b2-lactamase-mediated resistance.

In a chilling-sensitive cultivar (cv. Taichung Native 1, TN.1), level of free putrescine and activity of ADC in shoots increased slightly after exposure to chilling while those in roots decreased. Activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17) in both cultivars remained unchanged after exposure to chilling. \u03b1-Difluoromethylarginine (DFMA), an irreversible inhibitor of ADC, but not \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, at 0.5 mM inhibited free putrescine accumulation in chilled TNG.67 and resulted in a decrease in chilling tolerance; a decrease in survival and an increase in electrolyte leakage. The effects of DFMA were partially reversed by the addition of 0.5 mM putrescine. In TNG.67, chilling induced an increase of free ABA levels first, then ADC activity and finally free putrescine levels. Fluridone, an inhibitor of ABA synthesis, at 0.5 mM inhibited the increase of free ABA levels, ADC activity and free putrescine levels in chilled TNG.67, and resulted in a less tolerance of TNG.67 to chilling; these effects could be reversed by the pre-chilling treatment of 10 \u03bcM ABA. Application of 10 \u03bcM ABA for 48 h before chilling not only rendered TN.1 tolerant to chilling but also induced a change of polyamine pattern to be similar to chilled TNG.67.

The key questions regarding control of craniofacial morphogenesis and innervation of the gut illustrate the wide range of developmental contexts in which the neural crest plays an important role.

Gene transfer and substitution events are important processes in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. Gene loss is an ongoing process in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of higher plants. The gene for ribosomal protein S16 (rps16) is encoded in the chloroplast genome of most higher plants but not in Medicago truncatula and Populus alba.

We found that JQ1, a BET inhibitor, decreased desmoplastic stroma, a hallmark of PDAC, and suppressed the growth of patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) of PDACs. In vivo antitumor effects of JQ1 were not always associated with the JQ1 sensitivity of respective PDAC cells, and were rather dependent on the suppression of tumor-promoting activity in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). JQ1 inhibited Hedgehog and TGF-\u03b2 pathways as potent regulators of CAF activation and suppressed the expression of \u03b1-SMA, extracellular matrix, cytokines, and growth factors in human primary CAFs. Consistently, conditioned media (CM) from CAFs promoted the proliferation of PDAC cells along with the activation of ERK, AKT, and STAT3 pathways, though these effects were suppressed when CM from JQ1-treated CAFs was used. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that JQ1 reduced TGF-\u03b2-dependent gene expression by disrupting the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery containing BET proteins. Finally, combination therapy with gemcitabine plus JQ1 showed greater efficacy than gemcitabine monotherapy against PDAC in vivo.

However, those not achieving CR usually die early after diagnosis. Thus, to identify the refractory cases and how to overcome initial therapeutic resistance remain unsolved issues. We have previously reported that the gene encoding the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim is frequently inactivated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that substantially vary among the different B-cell lymphoma subgroups. Further screening of lymphoma samples revealed that silencing of BIM by promoter hyper-methylation occurred predominantly in Burkitt lymphoma, including 22 of 47 (47%) primary biopsies and 15 of 18 (83%) cell lines, while two additional Burkitt lymphoma-derived cell lines presented BIM homozygous deletion. BIM methylation was not associated with EBV tumor status or with the presence of MYC coding mutations. Quantitative ChIP revealed that most methylated lymphomas also showed deacetylation of histone 3 in BIM promoter mediated by HDAC complexes, but Bim post-transcriptional modifications were rarely observed. In contrast to lymphomas with unmethylated BIM, methylated/deacetylated tumors did not show alterations in other BCL2-family proteins, suggesting that transcriptional repression of Bim is critical and sufficient to impair apoptosis in Burkitt lymphoma. Indeed, in a series of clinically aggressive Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, BIM hypermethylation was associated with inferior CR rate (only 24% of methylated cases achieved CR vs. 83% of unmethylated cases, p=0.0002) and shorter overall survival (p=0.007). These data suggested that Bim silencing mediated initial therapeutic resistance in Burkitt lymphoma. To test this hypothesis, several Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were genetically manipulated by ectopic expression of BIM using retroviral vectors or by RNAi, and then incubated with various chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in Burkitt lymphoma therapy. Resistance to doxorubicin and impaired apoptosis were selectively correlated with decreased Bim expression levels. Accordingly, treatment of apoptotic-resistant cell lines with demethylating and/or histone deacetilase inhibitors alone or in combination restored Bim expression and reversed chemotherapeutic resistance in vitro. Concordant results were obtained by treating Burkitt lymphoma xenografts with different Bim expression levels that were developed in RAG2\u2212/\u2212IL2gc\u2212/\u2212 immunodeficient mice. Finally, B-cell lymphomas generated in Emu-MYC transgenes crossed with BIM knock-out mice were more resistant to apoptosis after doxorubicin treatment than Emu-MYC lymphomas.

This pathway is initially cytoprotective, allowing cells to survive stressful events; however, prolonged activation of the unfolded protein response also activates apoptotic responses. This balance is key in successful mammalian immune response and inducing cell death in malignant cells. We discuss how the unfolded protein response affects cancer progression, survival, and immune response to cancer cells. The literature shows that targeting the unfolded protein response as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapies increases the efficacy of these drugs; however, systemic unfolded protein response targeting may yield deleterious effects on immune cell function and should be taken into consideration.

Overall, 1.49% of transposon nucleotides showed either 4mC or 6mA modifications: the 4mC/6mA ratio was similar in Class I and Class II transposons, with a prevalence of 4mC, which is comparable to coding genes. Different percentages of 4mC or 6mA were observed among LTR-retrotransposon lineages and sub-lineages.

In the present study, we have shown for the first time that niranthin is a potent anti-leishmanial agent. The compound induces topoisomerase I-mediated DNA-protein adduct formation inside Leishmania cells and triggers apoptosis by activation of cellular nucleases. We also show that niranthin inhibits the relaxation activity of heterodimeric type IB topoisomerase of L. donovani and acts as a non-competitive inhibitor interacting with both subunits of the enzyme. Niranthin interacts with DNA-protein binary complexes and thus stabilizes the 'cleavable complex' formation and subsequently inhibits the religation of cleaved strand. The compound inhibits the proliferation of Leishmania amastigotes in infected cultured murine macrophages with limited cytotoxicity to the host cells and is effective against antimony-resistant Leishmania parasites by modulating upregulated P-glycoprotein on host macrophages. Importantly, besides its in vitro efficacy, niranthin treatment leads to a switch from a Th2- to a Th1-type immune response in infected BALB/c mice. The immune response causes production of nitric oxide, which results in almost complete clearance of the liver and splenic parasite burden after intraperitoneal or intramuscular administration of the drug.

Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were generated from human peripheral blood and labeled with red fluorescent PKH26. A portion of CIK cells was armed with CEA/CD3-bispecific single-chain antibody. When CIK cells were injected into nude mice with established subcutaneous gastric cancer via peritumoral (p.t.), intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) infusion respectively, the distribution of cells was observed using a live fluorescence imaging system. We found that only a very small number of CIK cells could travel to the tumor site after i.p. or i.v. infusion, and they inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo only immediately following injection. In contrast, p.t. injection resulted in a significantly higher accumulation of CIK cells at the tumor site for 48 hours and mediated the greatest tumor inhibition compared with the other two injection methods. In addition, we compared the antitumor activity of CIK, CEA/CD3-bscAb-CIK and CTL cells in vitro and in vivo after p.t. injection. Among the three types of immune cells, CTLs demonstrated the strongest antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. CEA/CD3-bispecific single chain antibody could effectively link T lymphocytes and tumor cells expressing CEA, and resulted in significantly higher accumulation of CIK cells at the tumor site compared with the parental CIK cells. This study indicates that peritumoral injection of immune effector cells by minimally invasive surgical procedures represents an effective delivery method of adoptive cellular immunotherapy. Tumor-specific immune cells, such as CTLs, are a better choice of effector cells than CIKs in cellular immunotherapy.

It is unknown what enzyme or other factor in the extracellular organelles is responsible for the activation. This study tested the hypothesis that enzymes present in matrix vesicles can activate latent TGF-\u03b21 and that this is regulated by 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3. To do this, we examined the ability of matrix vesicle extracts to activate small latent rhTGF-\u03b21. In addition, enzymes previously determined to be present in matrix vesicles were screened for their ability to activate small latent rhTGF-\u03b21. Recombinant human matrix metalloproteinase 2 (rhMMP-2; 72 kDa gelatinase), rhMMP-3 (stromelysin 1), purified human plasminogen, and purified urokinase (plasminogen activator) were each tested at varying concentrations. To assess the role of cell maturation, we used a cell culture model in which chondrocytes are derived from two distinct zones of rat costochondral cartilage, the resting zone and the growth zone. Matrix vesicles were isolated from these cultures and then tested. The results showed that extracts of matrix vesicles produced by both growth zone and resting zone chondrocytes were able to activate small latent rhTGF-\u03b21. The effects were dose and time dependent, with greater activity being found in extracts of matrix vesicles from the growth zone chondrocyte cultures. Only rhMMP-3 was able to activate small latent rhTGF-\u03b21, indicating that stromelysin-1, but not MMP-2, plasminogen, or urokinase, was involved. As observed in the extracts, the effect of rhMMP-3 was time and dose dependent. When anti-MMP-3 antibody was added to matrix vesicle extracts from both cell types, activation of small latent rhTGF-\u03b21 was dose-dependently blocked. Neither 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 nor 24R,25(OH)2D3 had a direct effect on activation of small latent rhTGF-\u03b21 by the extracts. However, when intact matrix vesicles were treated with 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3, their ability to activate small latent rhTGF-\u03b21 was increased. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 with quinacrine blocked the 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3-dependent effect. These results suggest that the ability of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3-treated matrix vesicles to activate small latent TGF-\u03b21 is via action of the secosteroid on the matrix vesicle membrane, not on the enzymes responsible for activating latent TGF-\u03b21. Because matrix vesicles isolated from growth zone chondrocytes have been shown to contain increased phospholipase A2 activity after treatment with 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3, it is likely that this secosteroid promotes loss of membrane integrity through phospholipase A2-dependent formation of lysophospholipids, resulting in the release of MMP-3 into the matrix, where latent TGF-\u03b21 is stored. Taken together, the results of the current study show that matrix vesicles produced by growth plate chondrocytes contain MMP-3, that this enzyme is at least partially responsible for activation of small latent TGF-\u03b21 in the matrix, and that 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 regulates MMP release from matrix vesicles.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2001-07-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.485107E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.3021963E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "87", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "11.154447", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "18", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Effect of Subinhibitory Concentrations of Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin on the Adherence of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to Vero Cells and Voided Uroepithelial Cells"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Effect of subinhibitory concentrations of Ciprofloxacin and gentamicin on the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Vero cells and voided uroepithelial cells."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "effect of subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin on the adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa to vero cells and voided uroepithelial cells"}], "abstract": {"$": "The effect of subinhibitory concentrations (1/8 x, 1/16 x, 1/32 x MIC) of ciprofloxacin or gentamicin on the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Vero cells and voided uroepithelial cells was studied using two different assay methods.

A 396-amino acid nuclear protein termed SNIP1 was cloned and shown to harbor a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. The carboxyl terminus of SNIP1 interacts with Smad1 and Smad2 in yeast two-hybrid as well as in mammalian overexpression systems.

In the presence of extracellular Mn2+, the Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormone vasopressin produced a severalfold stimulation of the basal rate of fura-2 fluorescence quenching as a result of Mn2+ influx; this effect was blocked by the presence of Ni2+ in the incubation medium. Half-maximum and maximum stimulation of Mn2+ influx was observed with 0.1 and 0.8 nM vasopressin, respectively. Agonist-stimulated Mn2+ influx was also seen with angiotensin II, ATP, phenylephrine, and the combination of AlCl3 and NaF. The stimulation of Mn2+ influx did not occur immediately after addition of Ca2(+)-mobilizing agents, but was characterized by a latency period of 20-30 s. In contrast to vasopressin, glucagon did not stimulate Mn2+ influx into hepatocytes, but produced both a 3-fold enhancement of the rate of vasopressin-stimulated Mn2+ entry and the abolishment of the latency period. The effects of glucagon were mimicked by forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with pertussis toxin or depolarization of the cells altered neither the basal rate of Mn2+ entry nor the ability of vasopressin to stimulate this rate. Emptying of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ store by treatment with 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ) did not enhance Mn2+ entry into hepatocytes; however, exposure of the cells to tBuBHQ for 2 min markedly enhanced the ability of vasopressin, alone or in combination with glucagon, to increase the rate of Mn2+ influx. Furthermore, pretreatment with tBuBHQ for 2 min abolished the latency of vasopressin-stimulated Mn2+ influx. It is concluded that Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormones stimulate Ca2+ influx in hepatocytes, possibly through receptor-operated Ca2+ channels. The stimulation of divalent cation entry is transduced by a G protein, and the rate of influx appears to be controlled both by the intracellular level of cAMP and the empty state of an intracellular Ca2+ pool that may be inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1990-10-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "1.7301781E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.5499493E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "166", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0064333384", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "73", "@class": "C3"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Tumor Microenvironment Modulation by Cyclopamine Improved Photothermal Therapy of Biomimetic Gold Nanorods for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Tumor Microenvironment Modulation by Cyclopamine Improved Photothermal Therapy of Biomimetic Gold Nanorods for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "tumor microenvironment modulation by cyclopamine improved photothermal therapy of biomimetic gold nanorods for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas"}], "abstract": {"$": "Due to the rich stroma content and poor blood perfusion, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a tough cancer that can hardly be effectively treated by chemotherapeutic drugs.

In the present study, a new photothermal therapy strategy of PDA was developed by combination of tumor microenvironment modulation and advanced design of biomimetic gold nanorods. On one hand, biomimetic gold nanorods were developed by coating gold nanorods (GNRs) with erythrocyte membrane (MGNRs). It was shown that MGNRs exhibited significantly higher colloidal stability in vitro, stronger photothermal therapeutic efficacy in vitro, and longer circulation in vivo than GNRs. On the other hand, tumor microenvironment modulation by cyclopamine treatment successfully disrupted the extracellular matrix of PDA and improved tumor blood perfusion. Moreover, cyclopamine treatment significantly increased the accumulation of MGNRs in tumors by 1.8-fold and therefore produced higher photothermal efficiency in vivo than the control group. Finally, cyclopamine treatment combined with photothermal MGNRs achieved the most significant shrinkage of Capan-2 tumor xenografts among all the treatment groups. Therefore, with the integrated advantages of tumor microenvironment regulation and long-circulation biomimetic MGNRs, effective photothermal therapy of PDA was achieved.

The mechanistic bases of carcinogenesis have demonstrated profound alteration of normative mitochondrial function, notably dysregulated respiratory processes. Accordingly, the classic Warburg effect functionally links aerobic glycolysis, aberrant production and release of lactate, and metabolic down-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative processes with the carcinogenetic phenotype.

The A(H7N9) patient isolate replicated similarly well as a seasonal IAV in explanted human lung tissue, whereas avian H7 subtype viruses propagated poorly. Interestingly, the avian H7 strains provoked a strong antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) response, whereas the A(H7N9) virus induced only low IFN levels.

Here, we demonstrate that an early virus isolate from the recent A(H7N9) outbreak in Eastern China replicated as efficiently as human-adapted IAV in explanted human lung tissue, whereas avian H7 subtype viruses were unable to propagate. Robust replication of the H7N9 strain correlated with a low induction of antiviral beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2), and cell-based studies indicated that this is due to efficient suppression of the IFN response by the viral NS1 protein.

Studies on the transportomes of these organisms yield information that may be utilized for various purposes, including the identification of novel drug targets and the manufacture of improved probiotic strains.

The present study is a continuation of our studies on the transport proteins of the major gut microbes. &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; species are essential members of the human gut microbiome, and they initiate colonization of the gut at birth, providing health benefits that last a lifetime. In this study we analyze the transportomes of nine bifidobacterial species: &lt;i&gt;B. adolescentis, B. animalis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. longum&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;infantis, B. longum&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;longum, and B. pseudocatenulatum&lt;/i&gt;. All of these species have proven probiotic characteristics and exert beneficial effects on human health. Surprisingly, we found that all nine of these species have similar pore-forming toxins and drug exporters that may play roles in pathogenesis. These species have transporters for amino acids, carbohydrates, and proteins, essential for their organismal lifestyles and adaption to their respective ecological niches. The strictly probiotic species, &lt;i&gt;B. bifidum&lt;/i&gt;, however, contains fewer such transporters, thus indicative of limited interactions with host cells and other gut microbial counterparts. The results of this study were compared with those of our previous studies on the transportomes of multiple species of &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides, Escherichia coli/Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, bifidobacteria have larger transportomes (based on percentages of total proteins) than the previously examined groups of bacterial species, with a preference for primary active transport systems over secondary carriers. Taken together, these results provide useful information about the physiologies and pathogenic potentials of these probiotic organisms as reflected by their transportomes. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-09-23"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.0387408E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.916695E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "3.56", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A subtelomeric satellite DNA family isolated from the genome of the dioecious plant <i>Silene latifolia</i>"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "A subtelomeric satellite DNA family isolated from the genome of the dioecious plant Silene latifolia."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a subtelomeric satellite dna family isolated from the genome of the dioecious plant silene latifolia"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p> In an ongoing effort to trace the evolution of the sex chromosomes of Silene latifolia, we have searched for the existence of repetitive sequences specific to these chromosomes in the genome of this species by direct isolation from low-melting agarose gels of satellite DNA bands generated by digestion with restriction enzymes. Five monomeric units belonging to a highly repetitive family isolated from Silene latifolia, the SacI family, have been cloned and characterized. The consensus sequence of the repetitive units is 313 bp in length (however, high variability exists for monomer length variants) and 52.9% in AT. Repeating units are tandemly arranged at the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes in this species. The sequence does not possess direct or inverted sequences of significant length, but short direct repeats are scattered throughout the monomer sequence. Several short sequence motives resemble degenerate monomers of the telomere repeat sequence of plants (TTTAGGG), confirming a tight association between this subtelomeric satellite DNA and the telomere repeats.

In this study, we evaluated AAV-9 transduction in the mouse retina.Three different AAV vectors were used in our study: AAV-9.RSV.AP, AAV-9.CMV.eGFP, and AAV-9.CMV.R4-23/C. In these vectors, two different promoters (the cytomegalovirus promoter-CMV promoter and the Rous sarcoma virus-RSV promoter) were used to express three different transgenes including the alkaline phosphatase (AP) gene, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene, and a therapeutic microdystrophin gene (the R4-23/C). Specifically, 1 microl AAV-9 reporter gene vectors (1x10(9) viral genome particles of AAV-9.RSV.AP or 1x10(10) viral genome particles of AAV-9.CMV.eGFP) were administered subretinally to young (2-3-week-old), adult (3-month-old), and old (12-month-old) C57BL/6J mice. To evaluate AAV-9 transduction in a diseased retina, we injected subretinally 1x10(9) viral genome particles of AAV-9.CMV.R4-23/C to mdx(3cv) mice, which we used as a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Transgene expression was examined by histochemical as well as immunofluorescence staining at three and five weeks after injection. Electroretinograms were recorded five weeks after subretinal AAV-9.RSV.AP injection.Subretinal injection yielded widespread transduction throughout the retina in all age groups. Robust expression was seen in the retinal pigment epithelium, outer nuclear layer, and in M\u00fcller cells. Interestingly a synaptic layer, the outer plexiform layer (OPL), also showed intensive expression. Transduction of the synaptic layer was further confirmed by immunostaining for C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2), a marker for the photoreceptor synaptic ribbon. Dystrophin is normally expressed in the OPL photoreceptor terminals. This expression is lost in DMD patients and mdx(3cv) mice. Consistent with our findings in normal mice, we observed efficient microdystrophin expression in the OPL after AAV-9.CMV.R4-23/C infection. At five weeks after subretinal delivery of AAV-9.RSV.AP, no morphology or ERG abnormalities were observed.We demonstrated that AAV-9 is a potent vector for retinal gene delivery.

Cyclin D3 and c-Myc levels in HeLa and fibrosarcoma cells correlated with sensitivity of these cells to TNF-induced apoptosis, as both proteins were highly expressed in TNF-sensitive HeLa D98 cells and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells but not in their TNF-resistant counterparts, HeLa H21 and SS-HT-1080 cells, respectively. All other cyclins tested were equally expressed in all tumor cell lines. Reduction in the expression of c-Myc by dexamethasone or inhibition of the transcriptional activity of c-Myc by introduction of a dominant negative form of c-Myc into TNF-sensitive HeLa D98 cells strongly suppressed the expression of cyclin D3 (but none of the other cyclins) and rendered the cells resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, introduction of the c-myc gene into TNF-resistant, c-Myc- and cyclin D3-deficient HeLa H21 cells resulted in enhanced cyclin D3 expression and TNF killing. When cyclin D3 expression in HeLa cells was altered by sense or antisense cyclin D3 cDNA, there was a concomitant alteration in their susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis without any change in c-Myc levels.

The influence of obesity and associated insulin resistance at launching the systemic inflammation leading to activation of immunological cascade resulting in terget organs damage in such patients is highlighted. The pathogenesis of liver, gall bladder and bile ducts damage at presence of metabolic disorders is outlined. The role of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in liver tissue damage is described. Based on the data of literature review and own data, it was shown that the lipid metabolism alterations are associated with liver functional damage, and liver in patients with metabolic syndrome is not only participating in atherogenic dislipoproteinemia development, but also damaged as the target organ. It was revealed that the key link in the gall bladder pathology in patients with metabolic syndrome is the lipid metabolism alterations that lead to the excess cholesterol bile excretion and cholesterol monohydrate crystals sedimentation. It was also shown that the functionally affected hepatocytes produce imperfect bile micelles with high cholesterol and low phospholipid levels, increasing the bile lithogenicity.

Sterol metabolism was affected by both cholesterol and cholesterol-alpha-epoxide. Cholesterol feeding decreased cholesterol synthesis (-9.57 +/- 7.23 mg/day), increased endogenous bile acid synthesis (7.71 +/- 1.18 mg/day), and increased cholesterol turnover (7.78 +/- 2.33 mg/day) compared to controls. Cholesterol-alpha-epoxide had no effect on cholesterol synthesis, endogenous bile acid synthesis and cholesterol turnover compared to controls. However, animals fed cholesterol-alpha-epoxide had large increases in total acidic steroid output (determined by chromatographic analysis, 12.33 +/- 4.05 mg/day). This finding suggests that cholesterol-alpha-epoxide is absorbed and converted to bile acids. Apparently, the epoxide enters the bile acid biosynthetic pathway distal to the rate-limiting step of 7 alpha-hydroxylation. As a result, large amounts of bile acids are formed from the epoxide without affecting endogenous cholesterol or bile acid synthesis. This was confirmed in a separate experiment by feeding [4-14C]cholesterol-alpha-epoxide and recovering labeled bile acids (hyodeoxycholic acid and lithyocholic acid) as well as the starting radioactively labeled epoxide in the feces."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1981-12-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.201781E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.393581E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.804661E-6", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for Cholera Serology"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for cholera serology."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for cholera serology"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle of Engvall and Perlmann, which employs antigen-coated tubes and enzyme-labeled anti-immunoglobulins, was elaborated for use in cholera serology.

Despite the apparent importance of IGF-I in articular cartilage metabolism and its potential importance in joint diseases, little is known about the regulation of IGF-I activity within the tissue. Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) bind IGF-I and can modify its activity. At least three IGFBPs are expressed by chondrocytes: IGFBP-3, -4 and -5. Localization of IGFPBs in the articular cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) could create reservoirs of IGF-I within the articular cartilage ECM and thereby regulate local IGF-I levels. We hypothesized that ECM molecules bind and concentrate IGFPBs in the pericellular/territorial matrix.Design Semi-quantitative immunohistological measures of co-localization were used to compare the spatial distribution of IGFBP-3, -4, and -5 with the distributions of three peri-cellularly-enriched matrix molecules fibronectin, tenascin-C, and type VI collagen in osteoarthritic and non-osteoarthritic human articular cartilage. Purified proteins were used in an agarose diffusion assay to compare IGFBP-3 binding to the same three matrix proteins.Results IGFBP-3 associated with fibronectin in the pericellular/territorial matrix (\u223c40% co-localization) but not with tenascin-C, or type VI collagen (\u223c6% and \u223c15% co-localization respectively, P< 0.05). Neither IGFBP-4, nor IGFBP-5 were associated with any of the three ECM proteins (P< 0.05). In agarose diffusion assays IGFBP-3 interacted with fibronectin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan but not with type VI collagen or tenascin-C.Conclusions Direct binding between purified IGFBP-3 and fibronectin and the strong co-localization the two proteins in the cartilage matrix support the hypothesis that IGFPB-3 and fibronectin help regulate local IGF-I levels.

We produced bacterially expressed UNC-78 protein and found that it enhances actin filament disassembly preferentially in the presence of a specific ADF/cofilin isoform. Extensive and rapid filament disassembly by UNC-78 was observed in the presence of UNC-60B, a muscle-specific C. elegans ADF/cofilin isoform. UNC-78 also reduced the rate of spontaneous polymerization and enhanced subunit dissociation from filaments in the presence of UNC-60B. However, in the presence of UNC-60A, a non-muscle C. elegans ADF/cofilin isoform, UNC-78 only slightly enhanced filament disassembly. Interestingly, UNC-78 failed to enhance disassembly by mouse muscle-type cofilin. Using mutant forms of UNC-60B, we demonstrated that the F-actin-specific binding site of UNC-60B at the C terminus is required for filament disassembly by UNC-78. UNC-78 was expressed in body wall muscle and co-localized with actin where UNC-60B was also present. Surprisingly, UNC-78 was co-localized with actin in unc-60B null mutants, suggesting that the AIP1-actin interaction is not dependent on ADF/cofilin in muscle.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of bone morphogenetic protein-2 with protein transduction domain (BMP-2/PTD;TATBMP-2) on bone regeneration. Rat calvarial defect model and osteoblastic differentiation model using MC3T3 cell were used for the purpose of the study. Materials and Methods: MC3T3 cells were cultured until they reached a confluence stage. The cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 500 ng/ml of BMP-2/PTD for 21 days and at the end of the treatment, osteoblastic differentiation was evaluated usingvon Kossa staining. An 8mm, calvarial, critical-size osteotomy defect was created in each of 48 male Spraque-Dawley rats (weight 250~300 g). Three groups of 16 animals each received either BMP-2/PTD (0.05mg/ml) in a collagen carrier, collagen only, or negative surgical control. And each group was divided into 2 and 8 weeks healing intervals. The groups were evaluated by histologic analysis(8 animals/group/healing intervals) Result: In osteoblastic differentiation evaluation test, a stimulatory effect of BMP-2/PTD was observed in 10ng/ml of BMP-2/PTD with no observation of dose-dependent manner. The BMP-2/PTD group showed enhanced local bone formation in the rat calvarial defect at 2 weeks. New bone was observed at the defect margin and central area ofthe defect. However, new bone formation was observed only in 50% of animals used for 2weeks. In addition, there was no new bone formation observed at 8 weeks. Conclusion: The results of the present study indicated that BMP-2/PTD(TATBMP-2) have an positive effect on the bone formation in vitro and in vivo.

While recent studies have proposed methods to infer who infected whom based on genetic distance between isolates from different individuals, the link between epidemiological relationship and genetic distance is still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the distribution of pairwise genetic distances between samples taken from infected hosts during an outbreak. We proposed an analytically tractable approximation to this distribution, which provides a framework to evaluate the likelihood of particular transmission routes. Our method accounts for the transmission of a genetically diverse inoculum, a possibility overlooked in most analyses. We demonstrated that our approximation can provide a robust estimation of the posterior probability of transmission routes in an outbreak and may be used to rule out transmission events at a particular probability threshold. We applied our method to data collected during an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ruling out several potential transmission links.

Rice is a valuable crop that is susceptible to salt and high temperatures. Here, we studied the role of flavanol 3-hydroxylase in response to combined salt and heat stress with the aim of better understanding the defensive mechanism of rice. We found that, compared with wild-type plants, the growth and development of transgenic plants were improved due to higher biosynthesis of kaempferol and quercetin. Furthermore, we observed that oxidative stress was decreased in transgenic plants compared with that in wild-type plants due to the reactive oxygen species scavenging activity of kaempferol and quercetin as well as the modulation of glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidase activity. The expression of high-affinity potassium transporter (<jats:italic>HKT</jats:italic>) and salt overly sensitive (<jats:italic>SOS</jats:italic>) genes was significantly increased in transgenic plants compared with in control plants after 12 and 24\u2009h, whereas sodium-hydrogen exchanger (<jats:italic>NHX</jats:italic>) gene expression was significantly reduced in transgenic plants compared with in control plants.

However, antagonistic cross talk was identified between these hormones when the duration of stress increased; SA accumulation increased, whereas ABA levels decreased. Although transgenic lines showed significantly increased Na+ ion accumulation, K+ ion accumulation was similar in transgenic and control plants, suggesting that increased flavonoid accumulation is crucial for balancing Na+/K+ ions. Overall, this study suggests that flavonoid accumulation increases the tolerance of rice plants to combined salt and heat stress by regulating physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-12-21"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.1551544E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.968718E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "60", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "43.76", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "60", "@class": "C3"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Role of potential bioactive metabolites from traditional Chinese medicine for type 2 diabetes mellitus: An overview"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Role of potential bioactive metabolites from traditional Chinese medicine for type 2 diabetes mellitus: An overview."}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease with persistent hyperglycemia primarily caused by insulin resistance (IR). The number of diabetic patients globally has been rising over the past decades. Although significant progress has been made in treating diabetes mellitus (DM), existing clinical drugs for diabetes can no longer fully meet patients when they face complex and huge clinical treatment needs. As a traditional and effective medical system, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a unique understanding of diabetes treatment and has developed many classic and practical prescriptions targeting DM. With modern medicine and pharmacy advancements, researchers have discovered that various bioactive metabolites isolated from TCM show therapeutic on DM. Compared with existing clinical drugs, these bioactive metabolites demonstrate promising prospects for treating DM due to their excellent biocompatibility and fewer adverse reactions. Accordingly, these valuable metabolites have attracted the interest of researchers worldwide. Despite the abundance of research works and specialized-topic reviews published over the past years, there is a lack of updated and systematic reviews concerning this fast-growing field. Therefore, in this review, we summarized the bioactive metabolites derived from TCM with the potential treatment of T2DM by searching several authoritative databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, and Springer Link. For the convenience of readers, the content is divided into four parts according to the structural characteristics of these valuable compounds (flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and others).

In those samples, FIB/SEM with nm resolution was used to visualize distribution of collagen fibrils in a three dimensional network extending from the pericellular region into the ECM. In addition, distribution of enzymes involved in procollagen processing were investigated in the alginate hydrogel by IHC. It was discovered that, at high cell seeding density, procollagen processing and fibril assembly was also occurring far away from the cell surface, indicating sufficient transport of procollagen and enzymes in the intercellular space. At lower cell seeding density, the concentration of enzymes involved in procollagen processing was presumably too low. FIB/SEM and SHG microscopy combined with IHC localization of specific proteins were shown to provide meaningful insight into ECM assembly of neocartilage, which will lead to better understanding of cartilage formation and development of new tissue engineering strategies."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2014-03-13"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.761587E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.4334979E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "40", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.601896", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "24", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Effect of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy or lactation on infant and child body composition: a systematic review"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Effect of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy or lactation on infant and child body composition: a systematic review."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "effect of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy or lactation on infant and child body composition a systematic review"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Effect of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy or lactation on infant and child body composition : a systematic review"}], "abstract": {"$": "n-3 (omega-3) Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) inhibit fat cell differentiation and fat storage in adults, and this has led to the hypothesis that maternal n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation may reduce fat mass in children.The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation in pregnancy or lactation on infant and child body composition in randomized controlled trials.MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant articles.

In budding cells, most MTs are nucleated by three to six small and motile \u03b3-tubulin\u2013containing MTOCs at the boundary of mother and daughter cell, which results in a polarized MT array.

Within 3 min after washout, MTOCs returned to the neck region and the polarized MT array was reestablished. MT motility and polarity of the MT array was lost in dynein mutants, indicating that dynein-based transport of MTs and MTOCs polarizes the MT cytoskeleton.

Although considered fragile, this microaerophilic bacterium is able to survive in various challenging environments, which subsequently constitutes multiple sources of transmission for human infection. To test the assumption of acquiring specific features for adaptation and survival, we established a workflow of phenotypic tests related to the survival and the persistence of recurrent and sporadic strains. A representative collection of 83 strains isolated over 13 years from human, mammal, poultry, and environmental sources in Luxembourg, representing different spreading patterns (endemic, epidemic, and sporadic), was screened for survival to oxidative stresses, for acclimating to aerobic conditions (AC), and for persistence on abiotic surfaces. Using the cgMLST Oxford typing scheme for WGS data, the collection was classified into genomic lineages corresponding to host-generalist strains (lineages A and D, CC ST-21), host-specific strains (lineage B, CC ST-257 and lineage C, CC ST-464) and sporadic strains. We established that when a strain survives concentrations beyond 0.25 mM superoxide stress, it is six times more likely to survive hyperoxide stress and that a highly adherent strain is 14 times more likely to develop a biofilm. Surprisingly, more than half of the strains could acclimate to AC but this capacity does not explain the difference between recurrent genomic lineages and sporadic strains and the survival to oxidative stresses, while recurrent strains have a significantly higher adhesion/biofilm formation capacity than sporadic ones. From this work, the genomic lineages with more stable genomes could be characterized by a specific combination of phenotypes, called metaphenotypes. From the functional genomic analyses, the presence of a potentially functional T6SS in the strains of lineage D might explain the propensity of these strains to be strong biofilm producers. Our findings support the hypothesis that phenotypical abilities contribute to the spatio-temporal adaptation and survival of stable genomic lineages. It suggests a selection of better-adapted and persistent strains in challenging stress environments, which could explain the prevalence of these lineages in human infections.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2022-09-07"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.953421E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.2424307E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.2", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "DNA methylome changes by estradiol benzoate and bisphenol A links early-life environmental exposures to prostate cancer risk"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "DNA methylome changes by estradiol benzoate and bisphenol A links early-life environmental exposures to prostate cancer risk."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "dna methylome changes by estradiol benzoate and bisphenol a links early life environmental exposures to prostate cancer risk"}], "abstract": {"$": "Developmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), 17\u03b2-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB) and bisphenol A (BPA), increases susceptibility to prostate cancer (PCa) in rodent models.

However, the inability of stem cells to efficiently return to the target tissue is a major obstacle to therapy. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 on homing of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) after partial hepatectomy and the mechanism by which they enhance liver regeneration. A mouse model of partial hepatectomy was established. Transcriptome sequencing was used to detect the expression of CCl2 in liver tissue. CCR2 was transfected with lentivirus into bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs), and the expression of CCR2 in BMSCs was detected by qRT-PCR. The effect of BMSCs overexpressing CCR2 on liver regeneration in mice with partial hepatectomy was detected by a liver index, HE staining and serum ALT and AST contents. The migration ability of BMSCs modified by CCR2 was observed by a transwell test and PKH26 staining. The influence of CCL2-CCR2 on the homing signalling pathway of BMSCs was detected by western blot and scratch experiments. It was found that CCL2 expression was up-regulated during the whole process of liver regeneration. BMSCs could express the CCR2 receptor, but lentivirus-transfected BMSCs could express more CCR2. The BMSCs modified by CCR2 showed strong migration ability. At 72 h after partial hepatectomy, compared with KM-BMSCs group, the liver index of the KM-BMSCs-CCR2 group was higher, the liver tissue structure was more normal, and the levels of ALT and AST were lower. Expression of the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway proteins increased in the liver of the KM-BMSCs-CCR2 group, while migration ability of BMSCs decreased after treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. In summary, this study suggested that the expression of CCR2 on BMSCs enhanced their targeted migration to the liver of partially hepatectomized mice and promoted liver regeneration.

Globally, the fish food sector has become very important to meet the growing human demand for food. In 2020, 89% of fish production was used for direct human consumption (17% of the total protein consumed). Global fish consumption has increased (excluding algae) at an annual rate of 3% since 1960. In 2030, the total fish production is expected to reach 202 million tons (MT) and the aquaculture production 106 MT. The United Nations has estimated that, between now and 2030, the global demand for fish products will increase by at least 40 MT each year. This need cannot be satisfied by fishing alone, given that fishing practices have reached an intensity that is unsustainable, and that climate change and pollution are worsening the problems of marine ecosystems. European and Italian aquaculture is characterised by a diversification scenario in terms of production systems, technologies adopted, and species bred. According to an EU report, Italian aquaculture production has grown by 4% in the last five years (fourth place in Europe). In Italy, rainbow trout is the most widely farmed species. The production of rainbow trout contributes approximately 25.5% of the total value and 69.9% of the volume of farmed fish. Over the past ten years, trout production has increased by 8.5% overall with an average annual growth rate of 2.5%. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the economic situation of the rainbow trout production and consumption sectors in Italy using a supply chain approach. In particular, in this brief excursus, the main production trends and the economic and organisational relationships between the various companies and associations in the aquaculture sector are analysed.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2022-08-31"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.6116035E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.9917506E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "40", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "32.12", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "40", "@class": "C3"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The role of homeostatic regulation between tumor suppressor DAB2IP and oncogenic Skp2 in prostate cancer growth"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "The role of homeostatic regulation between tumor suppressor DAB2IP and oncogenic Skp2 in prostate cancer growth."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the role of homeostatic regulation between tumor suppressor dab2ip and oncogenic skp2 in prostate cancer growth"}], "abstract": {"$": "Altered DAB2IP gene expression often detected in prostate cancer (PCa) is due to epigenetic silencing.

Other major glycosaminoglycans were found not to be involved in HCMV attachment and infectivity. In addition, HCMV was unable to attach to mutant derivatives of Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Basic fibroblast growth factor, which requires initial interaction with extracellular heparin prior to binding to its high affinity receptor, also inhibited HCMV attachment to cells.

The initial heparin-dissociable binding converted rapidly to high affinity (heparin resistant) HCMV attachment.

However, due to the variety of mitochondrial structures, automated mitochondria segmentation and reconstruction in electron microscopy (EM) images have proven to be a difficult and challenging task. This paper puts forward an effective and automated pipeline based on deep learning to realize mitochondria segmentation in different EM images. The proposed pipeline consists of three parts: (1) utilizing image registration and histogram equalization as image pre-processing steps to maintain the consistency of the dataset; (2) proposing an effective approach for 3D mitochondria segmentation based on a volumetric, residual convolutional and deeply supervised network; and (3) employing a 3D connection method to obtain the relationship of mitochondria and displaying the 3D reconstruction results. To our knowledge, we are the first researchers to utilize a 3D fully residual convolutional network with a deeply supervised strategy to improve the accuracy of mitochondria segmentation. The experimental results on anisotropic and isotropic EM volumes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and the Jaccard index of our segmentation (91.8% in anisotropy, 90.0% in isotropy) and F1 score of detection (92.2% in anisotropy, 90.9% in isotropy) suggest that our approach achieved state-of-the-art results.

The human KL gene encodes the \u03b1-Klotho protein, which is a multifunctional protein that regulates the metabolism of phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D. \u03b1-Klotho also may function as a hormone, although the \u03b1-Klotho receptor(s) has not been found.

In this study, we investigate the tissue requirements and signals necessary for specification of a pulmonary cell fate using embryo tissue explants. We show that NKX2.1, an early transcription factor crucial for lung development, is expressed in the ventral foregut endoderm shortly after albumin and Pdx1, early markers of the liver and pancreas lineages, respectively. Similar to hepatic specification,direct contact of cardiac mesoderm with ventral endoderm is required to induce in vitro expression of NKX2.1 and downstream lung target genes including surfactant protein C and Clara cell secretory protein. In the absence of cardiac mesoderm, ventral foregut endoderm explants respond to exogenous fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 and FGF2 in a dose-dependent manner, with lower concentrations activating liver specific genes and higher concentrations activating lung specific genes. This signaling appears to be instructive, as the prospective dorsal midgut endoderm, which predominantly gives rise to the intestinal tract, is competent to respond to FGFs by inducing NKX2.1. Furthermore, the temporal expression and selective inhibition of FGF receptors 1 and 4 present within the endoderm implies that signaling through FGFR4 is involved in specifying lung versus liver.

Species identification of the pathogen was made for all 21 specimens (sensitivity of 100%) where species-specific probes were included in the RLB; however, there was no ITS2 probe-based hybridization signal for two specimens. Results were concordant with the culture results for 18 (85.7%) specimens.

Chromosomally located integrons (CI) have been identified in a large number of environmental Gram-negative bacteria. Integron evolutionary history suggests that these sedentary CIs acquired mobility among bacterial species through their association with transposable elements and conjugative plasmids. As a result of massive antibiotic use, these so-called mobile integrons are now widespread in clinically relevant bacteria and are considered to be the principal agent in the emergence and rise of antibiotic multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria.

A minority of oligodendrocytes is also recognized to emerge from dorsal progenitors during fetal development. The prevailing view is that generation of ventral oligodendrocytes depends on Sonic hedgehog (Shh) while dorsal oligodendrocytes develop under the influence of Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs).Using the well-established model of the chicken embryo, we show that ventral spinal progenitor cells activate FGF signaling at the onset of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) generation. Inhibition of FGF receptors at that time appears sufficient to prevent generation of ventral OPCs, highlighting that, in addition to Shh, FGF signaling is required also for generation of ventral OPCs. We further reveal an unsuspected interplay between Shh and FGF signaling by showing that FGFs serve dual essential functions in ventral OPC specification. FGFs are responsible for timely induction of a secondary Shh signaling center, the lateral floor plate, a crucial step to create the burst of Shh required for OPC specification. At the same time, FGFs prevent down-regulation of Olig2 in pMN progenitor cells as these cells receive higher threshold of the Shh signal. Finally, we bring arguments favoring a key role of newly differentiated neurons acting as providers of the FGF signal required to trigger OPC generation in the ventral spinal cord.Altogether our data reveal that the FGF signaling pathway is activated and required for OPC commitment in the ventral spinal cord.

However, it is not clear if the role of the N7 glycan is conserved among diverse HIV-1 isolates and if other glycans in the conserved regions of HIV-1 Env display similar functions. In this work, we examined the role of PNLGs in the conserved region of HIV-1 Env, particularly the role of the N7 glycan in a panel of HIV-1 strains representing different clades, tissue origins, coreceptor usages, and neutralization sensitivities. We demonstrate that the absence of the N7 glycan increases the sensitivity of diverse HIV-1 isolates to CD4bs- and V3 loop-directed antibodies, indicating that the N7 glycan plays a conserved role masking these conserved epitopes. However, the effect of the N7 glycan on virus sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies directed against the V2 loop epitope is isolate dependent.

The observation that the antigenicity of the receptor and coreceptor binding sites can be modulated by a single glycan indicates that select glycan modification offers a potential strategy for the design of HIV-1 vaccine candidates.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2016-01-15"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.3150174E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.6590053E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "20", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.8867917", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "14", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Use of immunoblot detection of serum antibodies in the diagnosis of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Use of immunoblot detection of serum antibodies in the diagnosis of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "use of immunoblot detection of serum antibodies in the diagnosis of chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis"}], "abstract": {"$": "Antibodies to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated in serum from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by immunoblotting (Western blotting).

Rates of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis were assessed by monitoring [1-(13)C]glucose label incorporation into [1-(13)C]glycogen, [3-(13)C]lactate, and [3-(13)C]alanine in the hindlimb of awake rats via 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy during a euglycemic (approximately 6 mmol/l) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 180 microU/ml) clamp. A steady-state isotopic analysis of lactate, alanine, and glutamate was used to determine the relative PDH versus TCA cycle flux present in muscle under these conditions. The safflower oil-fed rats were insulin resistant compared with control and fish oil-fed rats, as reflected by a markedly reduced glucose infusion rate (Ginf) during the clamp (21.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 31.6 +/- 2.8 and 31.7 +/- 1.9 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) in safflower oil versus control and fish oil groups, respectively, P &amp;lt; 0.006).

The extent of VDR loss corresponded inversely to the level of \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization and could be observed in early lesions composed of just a few crypts. Analysis of reported VDR regulators showed that the repressing class I histone deacetylases (HDAC) were significantly elevated in the tumors (up to 4-fold), whereas the VDR-activating retinoid X receptors (RXR) were downregulated (\u223c50%). Expression of the Slug repressor was also increased, but was found primarily in stromal cells. Analysis of epigenetically active compounds on colon cell lines and intestinal organoids showed that HDAC inhibitors were particularly adept at stimulating VDR expression. Treatment of tumor-bearing Apc\u039414/+ mice with the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat increased VDR expression in the tumors and normal mucosa. The RXR agonist bexarotene failed to activate VDR expression, indicating that RXR ligands were not limiting. Analysis of human microarray data indicated that VDR mRNA is frequently downregulated in colon adenomas, which correlated positively with RXRA expression and inversely with HDAC 2 and 8 expression. Human adenomas showed variable VDR protein expression levels, both between and within individual lesions.

Cancer represents a group of malignantly proliferative diseases. Recently, metabolic reprogramming changes were extremely highlighted in cancer cells, putting forward to a trend that cancer should also be treated as a type of metabolic disease [2]. As a matter of fact, statins, the most prescribed low density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering agents, and metformin, the most prescribed antidiabetic drug, have both been reported to associate with decreased cancer risk [3, 4].    Meanwhile, in the past decade, a growing body of evidence has implicated that increased oxidative stress is a common and key feature of metabolic diseases [5]. Whereas a recent hypothesis paper by Watson, the famous Nobel Prize winner, suggests that diabetes, dementias, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers may be linked to a failure to generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) [6], which maybe reflects the situations in end stages of these complex diseases. ROS play very important roles in carcinogenesis and the maintenance of cancer cells. The ROS levels are reported to be very high in cancer cells, which drive the high rate of proliferation in these malignant cells [7]. Whether prooxidants or antioxidants could be used to treat cancer or not remains elusive.    In this controversial context, we organized this special issue.    Although insulin is critically involved in metabolism regulation and closely associates with both diabetes and cancer, the precise molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this special issue, Q. Li et al. conducted an interesting study, which demonstrates that insulin increases pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression through ROS for the regulation of glucose consumption and lactate production \u201cInsulin regulates glucose consumption and lactate production through reactive oxygen species and pyruvate kinase M2\u201d. J. Zhao et al. demonstrated that pubertal obesity was associated with increased oxidative stress in testis tissue and high levels of leptin, which maybe the cause of male hypogonadism in obesity \u201cLeptin level and oxidative stress contribute to obesity-induced low testosterone in murine testicular tissue.\u201d Oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is the major lipid found in atherosclerotic lesion and elevated plasma oxLDL is recognized to be a risk factor of atherosclerosis. W. Li et al. in this special issue emphasized the critical role of oxLDL transcytosis across endothelial cells in the initiation of atherosclerosis, providing novel insight into the pathogenesis of this complex metabolism disease \u201cEndogenous ceramide contributes to the transcytosis of oxLDL across endothelial cells and promotes its subendothelial retention in vascular wall.\u201d For the therapy of metabolic syndrome-related disorders, J. Wang et al. reported in this special issue that amagnolia extract, named BL153, could prevent obesity-induced liver damage via inhibition of lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress \u201cBL153 partially prevents high fat diet induced liver damage probably via inhibition of lipid accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\u201d Centella asiatica is a traditional Chinese medicine which has been reported to have antioxidant effect in vitro. In this special issue, Y. Zhao et al. further reported that Centella asiatica decreased cholesterol and triglyceride in mice model \u201cEffect of Centella asiatica on oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic animal models.\u201d Salidroside (SAL) is an active component of Rhodiola Rosea with documented antioxidative properties. S. Xing et al. in this issue further demonstrated that SAL could protect endothelium against H2O2-induced injury via promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and function, thus preventing the over-activation of oxidative stress-related downstream signaling pathways \u201cSalidroside stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and protects against H2O2-Induced endothelial dysfunction.\u201d    In cancer cells, the ROS is maintained at higher levels than normal cells and mainly exerts its proliferative actions. When ROS levels are further increased by prooxidants so as to exceed a border line level, the proapoptotic effects of ROS may exceed its proliferative effects and cytotoxic effects display in cancer cells, whereas the ROS levels in normal cells remain below the border line level which is nontoxic to normal cells. In consistent with this view, several studies in this special issue reported chemicals could kill cancer cells by inducing ROS accumulation as cancer killing agents. Piperlongumine (PL) is a natural alkaloid from Piper longum L., possessing highly selective and effective anticancer property. L.-H. Gong et al. reported in this special issue that PL notably induced cell apoptosis, G2/M phase arrest and intracellular ROS accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with antioxidant N\u2013acety-L-cysteine could reverse the PL-induced ROS accumulation and cellular apoptosis. In addition, low-dose of PL/cisplatin or paclitaxel combination therapies had a synergistic anti-growth effect on human ovarian cancer cells \u201cPiperlongumine induces apoptosis and synergizes with cisplatin or paclitaxel in human ovarian cancer cells.\u201d Q. R. Liu et al. also reported that Piperlongumine effectively inhibited the migration of human glioma cells but not normal astrocytes in the scratch-wound culture model. PL increased ROS production, reduced glutathione, activated p38 and JNK pathway, increased I\u03baB and suppressed NF-\u03baB in LN229 cells after scratching \u201cPiperlongumine inhibits migration of glioblastoma cells via activation of ROS-dependent p38 and JNK signaling pathways\u201d. Similarly, H. Li et al. also reported in this issue that Lithium chloride, the established glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) inhibitor, induced the apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells by induction of ROS signaling \u201cLithium chloride suppresses colorectal cancer cell survival and proliferation through ROS/GSK-3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\u201d    In contrast to above observations which demonstrate that induction of ROS may be used to treat cancers, Y-Q. Xue et al., in this special issue reviews the preventive or anticancer properties of resveratrol oligomers. Resveratrol is a naturally derived phytoalexin stilbene isolated from grapes and other plants with documented antioxidant activity \u201cResveratrol oligomers for the prevention and treatment of cancers.\u201d In line with this review, Y. Li et al. reported that NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4)-derived reactive oxygen species might play crucial roles in the invasion, angiogenesis and radioresistance in glioblastoma. Inhibition of Nox4 by lentivirus-mediated small hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) could be a strategy to overcome radioresistance and in turn improve the therapeutic efficacy \u201cLentivirus-mediated Nox4 shRNA invasion and angiogenesis and enhances radiosensitivity in human glioblastoma.\u201d These studies suggest that in addition to prooxidant therapy, antioxidants may also be the right option to treat cancers as cancer inhibiting agents.    In addition to above mentioned pathological or pharmacological studies, Elizabeth Moreno-Arriola et al. present an interesting review which suggests that Caenorhabditis elegans, which may be one of the most famous model organisms, is also a suitable disease model reflecting the oxidative status in metabolic disorders, providing new approaches for studying metabolic diseases \u201cCaenorhabditis elegans: a useful model for studying metabolic disorders in which oxidative stress is a contributing factor.\u201d    From these collected studies in this special issue, we appear to come to the consensus that upregulated oxidative stress indeed promotes the development of both metabolic syndrome and cancer. Antioxidants are suitable choices for the prevention or treatment of metabolic syndrome-based cardiovascular diseases or diabetic mellitus, which are also classified as chronic nonresolving inflammatory diseases [8]. However, for the treatment of cancers, both prooxidants and antioxidants might work via different mechanisms, provided that the drug selectivity on targeted tissue is guaranteed. We hope that the studies and discussions gathered in this issue reflect the current trend in this area and could, to some extent, stimulate more in-depth studies in this somehow controversial field."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2014-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.0353628E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.1355174E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "6", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.9740083", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Mechanism of induction of binucleated cells by multiwalled carbon nanotubes as revealed by live-cell imaging analysis"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Mechanism of induction of binucleated cells by multiwalled carbon nanotubes as revealed by live-cell imaging analysis."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "mechanism of induction of binucleated cells by multiwalled carbon nanotubes as revealed by live cell imaging analysis"}], "abstract": {"$": "Asbestos-induced formation of mesothelioma has been attributed to phenotypic and morphological changes in cells caused by polyploidization and aneuploidization, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are suspected to have similar adverse effects due to the similarity in their physical form.

These two subclones exhibited differential chemotherapy sensitivity -- when xenografts were treated with cisplatin for 3 weeks, the post-treatment volume change was proportional to the post-treatment ratio of subclones on a xenograft-to-xenograft basis. A subsequent cohort in which xenografts were treated with cisplatin, allowed a drug holiday, then treated a second time continued to exhibit this proportionality. In contrast, xenografts from other treatment cohorts, spatially dissected xenograft fragments, and cell cultures evolved unsystematically but with substantial population bottlenecks. These results show that ecologies susceptible to successive retreatment can arise spontaneously in breast cancer in spite of a background of irregular subclonal bottlenecks, and our work provides to our knowledge the first quantification of the population genetics of such a system. Intriguingly, in such an ecology the ratio of common subclones is predictive of the state of treatment susceptibility, suggesting that this ratio can be measured to optimize dynamic treatment protocols in patients.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>AUTHOR SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>An overarching challenge of cancer is that patients develop resistance to treatment -- an essentially evolutionary process. However, there is currently very little understanding of how tumor evolution can be exploited to improve treatment. One reason for this is that usually only 1-2 samples can be obtained per patient, so cancer evolutionary processes are still poorly understood. To solve this problem, we created many dozens of copies of the tumors from two breast cancer patients using xenografting and cell culture methods. We then compared the evolution in these tumor copies in response to different treatments, including four of the most common breast cancer chemotherapies. These studies present the most exhaustive comparisons of treatment-induced evolution that have yet been performed for individual cancer patients. Unexpectedly, high-resolution sequencing of these samples revealed a special dynamically treatable ecology in one tumor, in which tumor growth during platinum therapy was determined by the ecological balance of two tumor cell populations. Our work shows that ecologies that can be targeted by dynamic treatment strategies arise spontaneously in breast cancers. Population heterogeneity is common within cancers, and our work suggests how tracking of intratumoral evolution can be used to optimize treatment.</jats:p></jats:sec>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2018-01-18"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.4185723E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The challenges of translation"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "The challenges of translation."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the challenges of translation"}], "abstract": {"$": "Cancer immunotherapy is a highly active area in translational medicine where the challenges and rewards of developing new drugs \"from bench to bedside\" become particularly visible.

Nowadays, the Food and Drug Administration approved the administration of three drugs, aiming at increasing the SMN production: although assuring noteworthy results, all these therapies show some non-negligible limitations, making essential the identification of alternative/synergistic therapeutic strategies. To offer a valuable in vitro experimental model for easily performing preliminary screenings of alternative promising treatments, we optimized an organotypic spinal cord culture (derived from murine spinal cord slices), which well recapitulates the pathogenetic features of SMA. Then, to validate the model, we tested the effects of human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) or murine C2C12 cells (a mouse skeletal myoblast cell line) conditioned media: 1/3 of conditioned medium (obtained from either hMSCs or C2C12 cells) was added to the conventional medium of the organotypic culture and maintained for 7 days. Then the slices were fixed and immunoreacted to evaluate the MN survival. In particular we observed that the C2C12 and hMSCs conditioned media positively influenced the MN soma size and the axonal length respectively, without modulating the glial activation. These data suggest that trophic factors released by MSCs or muscular cells can exert beneficial effects, by acting on different targets, and confirm the reliability of the model.

The genetic improvement of plants is one option to manage diseases. Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for disease resistance have been identified, but these contain many genes and the mechanisms by which resistance is imparted are unknown. These operative factors are crucial to assure precise breeding. Several OMICs tools have emerged, along with genomics, to elucidate resistance mechanisms of plants to pathogens. For example, metabolomics of plant\u2013pathogen interactions have led to the discovery of several complex metabolites that are deposited to reinforce secondary cell walls and prevent the spread of the pathogen beyond the initial infection site. Resistance in plants is largely due to antimicrobial biochemicals and/or the structures formed from them; both these lines of defence may be constitutive or induced following pathogen invasion. Pathogen perception leads to induction of resistance-related (RR) proteins and metabolites. Both constitutive and induced RR metabolites are biosynthesized by metabolic pathway genes. The RR proteins and metabolite biosynthetic genes are regulated by hierarchies of resistance (<i>R</i>) genes. A non-functional gene or \u2018missing link\u2019 in this hierarchy can inhibit the regulation of genes in specific metabolic pathway and protein production, thus reducing the amounts of RR metabolites and proteins, as well as the associated resistance. In addition, the non-functional biosynthetic <i>R</i> genes also can limit RR proteins and metabolites. Precise replacement of these non-functional genes (<i>r</i>) with functional <i>R</i> genes using genome editing tools, similar to backcross breeding, can significantly improve resistance in commercial crops.

One of the post-transcriptional regulatory pathways involves small RNA (sRNA)-guided, Argonaute (AGO) protein complex-mediated target cleavages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the well-known sRNA species participating in the cleavage-based regulation of gene expression. In plants, most miRNAs are incorporated into AGO1-associated silencing complexes. Thus, the AGO1 protein is considered to be the most important slicer for sRNA-mediated target cleavages. Previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that AGO1, AGO5, and AGO10 belonged to the same clade in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In addition, experimental evidence pointed to the possibility that AGO2, AGO7, and AGO10 were implicated in specific miRNA-mediated regulatory pathways. To investigate the potential slicer activities of AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10, a comprehensive search was performed for the sRNAs enriched in the four AGO proteins in Arabidopsis.

Alternatively, or in addition, induction could rely on astral microtubules to relax the polar cortex (polar relaxation). To investigate the relationship between microtubules, cortical stiffness, and contractile ring assembly, we used different configurations of microtubules to manipulate the distribution of actin in living silkworm spermatocytes. Mechanically repositioned, noninterdigitating microtubules can induce redistribution of actin at any region of the cortex by locally excluding cortical actin filaments. This cortical flow of actin promotes regional relaxation while increasing tension elsewhere (normally at the equatorial cortex). In contrast, repositioned interdigitating microtubule bundles use a novel mechanism to induce local stimulation of contractility anywhere within the cortex; at the antiparallel plus ends of central spindle microtubules, actin aggregates are rapidly assembled de novo and transported laterally to the equatorial cortex. Relaxation depends on microtubule dynamics but not on RhoA activity, whereas stimulation depends on RhoA activity but is largely independent of microtubule dynamics.

Next, neuroinflammatory response was tested after exposure to size-selected 20 nm combustion-generated nanoparticles (CGNP) collected from a modern diesel engine.

Depletion of Lx8-SINE B2 disrupted ESC proliferation, repressed the expression of pluripotency genes, activated differentiation genes, and inhibited reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells. The reduction of the colony formation ability of ESCs upon Lx8-SINE B2 knockdown was accompanied by the elongation of the G1 phase and the shortening of the S phase. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Lx8-SINE B2 deficiency affected multiple metabolic pathways, particularly glycolysis. Mechanistically, Lx8-SINE B2 functions as a cytoplasmic lncRNA and interacts with the glycolytic enzyme Eno1 as shown by RNA pull-down and RNA localization analysis. Lx8-SINE B2 and Eno1 interact with and regulate each other\u2019s expression, hence promoting the expression of metabolic genes and influencing glycolysis.

Among the top up-regulated lncRNAs in NPM1-mutated (NPM1mut) CN-AML, the lncRNA HOXB-AS3 wasidentified. As aberrant expression of HOX genes is associated with NPM1mut AML and HOX-related lncRNAs have been reported to regulate HOX genes (e.g. HOTAIR), we hypothesized that HOXB-AS3 could have a functional role in this disease setting.</jats:p>                <jats:p>Methods:HOXB-AS3 expression profiling was performed by qRT-PCR in AML cell lines (Kasumi-1, KG1a, MOLM-13, MV-4-11, OCI-AML3 and THP-1), 12 primary CN-AML patient samples (NPM1mut=6, NPM1-wild-type (WT)=6) and mononuclear cells from healthy donors (n=6). Correlation analysis of mRNA/lncRNA expression was performed using Spearman analysis in 71 older CN-AML patients, profiled by RNA-sequencing. Knock-down (KD) of HOXB-AS3 was performed in vitro (Amaxa-nucleoporation) and in vivo (in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model) using LNA-modified gapmers. Comparative proteomic analysis was conducted by applying a modified version of the RNA antisense purification (RAP) protocol (McHugh et al, 2015).</jats:p>                <jats:p>Results:Of the cell lines tested, only OCI-AML3, which harborsmutated NPM1, showed high levels of HOXB-AS3 expression. Five- and 3-prime RACE assays identified 3 previously annotated (NR_033201/NR_033203/ENST000491264) and 1 novel variant of HOXB-AS3 in OCI-AML3 cells. NPM1 mutated patient samples exhibited higher expression of HOXB-AS3 in comparison to those with WT NPM1 (P&lt;.01) and healthy donors (P&lt;.01). To gain insights into the function of HOXB-AS3, we derived a HOXB-AS3-related mRNA expression signature; 154 mRNA transcripts correlated positively and 122 correlated negatively with high HOXB-AS3 expression. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in the pathway of DNA repair (P&lt;.01) in patients with high HOXB-AS3 expression.</jats:p>                <jats:p>To assess the functional impact of HOXB-AS3, HOXB-AS3 KD studies using LNA gapmers were performed. In vitro KD of HOXB-AS3 led to decreased proliferation of OCI-AML3 cells, as measured by BrdU-based cell cycle analysis (S-phase average % in control v KD: 24% v 16%, P=.02). HOXB-AS3 KD also led to a reduction in the number of formed colonies by OCI-AML3 cells (P&lt;.01), whereas it had no significant effect on apoptosis. HOXB-AS3 KD in primary NPM1mut AML samples (n=3) led to a decrease in colony formation (P&lt;.01). Gene set enrichment analysisperformed in HOXB-AS3 silenced OCI-AML3 cells (profiled by RNAseq) revealed activation of the DNA damage response pathway in the HOXB-AS3 expressing cells.</jats:p>                <jats:p>To assess the in vivo effects of HOXB-AS3 KD,we treated 10 NSG mice transplanted with the blasts of a NPM1mut AML patient with nanoparticle-formulated anti-HOXB-AS3 gapmers or control gapmers. We obtained RNA after 7 days of treatment and confirmed HOXB-AS3 KD in human cells (P&lt;.01). Survival analysis is currently ongoing but when we compared the leukemia burden at 3- and 6-weeks post-transplant in mice with adequate leukemia engraftment (&gt;30% human CD45+ cells) the percentage of circulating blasts decreased in HOXB-AS3-KD (from 43% to 30%), while it increased in controls (from 36.5% to 62.8%). Last, to identify potential HOXB-AS3-binding proteins we performed RAP experiments in OCI-AML3 cells. HOXB-AS3- and U1-specificRNA-protein complexes were isolated by hybridization with biotinylated probes. Mass spectrometry and comparative analysis of theeluates yielded 22 candidate HOXB-AS3-interacting RNA-binding proteins. These included the core components of the DSHB complex (SFPQ and NONO). RNA-immunoprecipitation experiments validated the interaction of HOXB-AS3 with NONO. The DSHB complex is a major mediator of the DNA damage response and experiments that will elucidate the importance of HOXB-AS3 interaction with NONO in this context are underway.</jats:p>                <jats:p>Conclusions: HOXB-AS3 is highly expressed in NPM1mut CN-AML and regulates cell cycle progression of AML blasts. HOXB-AS3 KD decreases cell proliferation and colony formation capacity of leukemia cells in vitro. HOXB-AS3 KD also decreases leukemia burden in an in vivo PDX model. Comparative proteomic analyses identified several binding partners of HOXB-AS3, such as the DSHB complex, which is a key mediator of the DNA repair process.</jats:p>                <jats:sec>                   <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>                   <jats:p>No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.</jats:p>                </jats:sec>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2016-12-02"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9561378E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.4635263E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.470016", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "&lt;p&gt;Spoligotype and Drug Susceptibility Profiles of &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; Complex Isolates in Golestan Province, North Iran&lt;/p&gt;"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Spoligotype and Drug Susceptibility Profiles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Isolates in Golestan Province, North Iran"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "spoligotype and drug susceptibility profiles of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates in golestan province north iran"}], "abstract": {"$": "INTRODUCTION: Despite the moderate incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in many parts of Iran, Golestan province had a permanently higher TB incidence rate than the national average. Moreover, Golestan province receives immigrants, mainly from TB-endemic areas of Iran and neighbor countries. Here, we aimed to characterize the circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates in terms of the spoligotype and drug resistance patterns, across Golestan province. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 166 MTBC isolates was collected during July 2014 to July 2015 and subjected to drug susceptibility testing for first- and second-line anti-TB drugs and spoligotyping. RESULTS: Of 166 MTBC isolates, 139 (83.7%) isolates were assigned to 28 spoligotype international types (SITs). The most frequent SITs were SIT127/Ural-2 (n=25, 15.1%), followed by SIT1/Beijing (n=21, 12.7%) and SIT3427/Ural-2 (n=18, 10.8%). The set of 18 isolates (10.8%) showed resistance to at least one drug, which mainly belonged to SIT1/Beijing (n=7, 38.9%), orphan patterns (n=4, 22.2%) and SIT357/CAS1-Delhi (n=3, 16.7%). In addition, four isolates (2.4%) were resistant to pyrazinamide. The analysis of mutation corresponded to resistance to rifampin and isoniazid showed that two isolates had Ser531Leu substitution in rpoB, four isolates had Ser315Thr substitution in katG and one isolate had [C(\u221215)T] in inhA locus. CONCLUSION: High diversity in spoligotypes of the MTBC isolates and lack of dominant genotype might be due to residence of immigrants in this region and consequent reactivation of latent infection. In addition, due to the presence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates in Golestan province, it is important to conduct future studies to determine transmission pattern of drug-resistant isolates in this region."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-07-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.8802705E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.817068E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.216", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Generation of Human iNKT Cell Lines"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Generation of Human iNKT Cell Lines."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "generation of human inkt cell lines"}], "abstract": {"$": "Natural killer T (NKT) cells comprise an important immunoregulatory T cell subset and express cell surface proteins characteristic of both natural killer cells and T cells.

Adenoviruses (Ads) have become the promise of new therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. The objective of this review is to discuss current advances in the applications of adenoviral vectors in cancer therapy. Adenoviral vectors can be engineered in different ways so as to change the tumor microenvironment from cold tumor to hot tumor, including; 1. by modifying Ads to deliver transgenes that codes for tumor suppressor gene (p53) and other proteins whose expression result in cell cycle arrest 2. Ads can also be modified to express tumor specific antigens, cytokines, and other immune-modulatory molecules. The other strategy to use Ads in cancer therapy is to use oncolytic adenoviruses, which directly kills tumor cells. Gendicine and Advexin are replication-defective recombinant human p53 adenoviral vectors that have been shown to be effective against several types of cancer. Gendicine was approved for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency in 2003 as a first-ever gene therapy product. Oncorine and ONYX-015 are oncolytic adenoviral vectors that have been shown to be effective against some types of cancer. The Chiness FDA agency has also approved Oncorin for the treatment of head and neck cancer. Ads that were engineered to express immune-stimulatory cytokines and other immune-modulatory molecules such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, BiTE, CD40L, 4-1BBL, GM-CSF, and IFN have shown promising outcome in treatment of cancer. Ads can also improve therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapy (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells).

Through these efforts, we found that disruption of Wnt4 and components of the canonical Wnt pathway results in a complex germ cell phenotype marked by an expansion of GSC-like cells, pre-cystoblasts and cystoblasts in young females. This phenotype correlates with an increase of decapentaplegic (dpp) mRNA levels within escort cells and varying levels of BMP responsiveness in the germline. Further genetic experiments show that Wnt4, which exhibits graded expression in somatic cells of germaria, activates the Wnt pathway in posteriorly positioned escort cells. The activation of the Wnt pathway appears to be limited by the BMP pathway itself, as loss of Mad in escort cells results in the expansion of Wnt pathway activation. Wnt pathway activity changes within germaria during the course of aging, coincident with changes in dpp production.

One important mechanism of VDR action is related to its interaction with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Agonist-bound VDR inhibits the oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF pathway by interacting directly with beta-catenin and in some cells by increasing cadherin expression which, in turn, recruits beta-catenin to the membrane. Here we identify TCF-4, a transcriptional regulator and beta-catenin binding partner as an indirect target of the VDR pathway.In this work, we show that TCF-4 (gene name TCF7L2) is decreased in the mammary gland of the VDR knockout mouse as compared to the wild-type mouse. Furthermore, we show 1,25(OH)2D3 increases TCF-4 at the RNA and protein levels in several human colorectal cancer cell lines, the effect of which is completely dependent on the VDR. In silico analysis of the human and mouse TCF7L2 promoters identified several putative VDR binding elements. Although TCF7L2 promoter reporters responded to exogenous VDR, and 1,25(OH)2D3, mutation analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, showed that the increase in TCF7L2 did not require recruitment of the VDR to the identified elements and indicates that the regulation by VDR is indirect. This is further confirmed by the requirement of de novo protein synthesis for this up-regulation.Although it is generally assumed that binding of beta-catenin to members of the TCF/LEF family is cancer-promoting, recent studies have indicated that TCF-4 functions instead as a transcriptional repressor that restricts breast and colorectal cancer cell growth.

The muscle mass is mainly determined by the total number of muscle fibres (hyperplasia), their thickness (hypertrophy) and different fibre types. Hyperplasia occurs during either embryogenesis or the early posthatching period. Skeletal muscles originate from the dermatomyotome, which differentiates into four myogenic cell populations: myotomal cells, embryonic myoblasts, fetal myoblasts and satellite cells; the latter are the adult myoblasts, present within adult skeletal muscles to serve as a cell source for both muscle regeneration and self-renewal. Pax3 keeps migrated precursor cells non-differentiated, thereby controlling transcription of the MyoD gene, whereas Pax7 is a significant regulator of the satellite cell population. Manipulation of temperature and light quality and quantity have been proposed as methods of both pre- and postnatal myogenesis stimulation. Being thermogenic stimulants, both thyroid and adrenal hormones substantially stimulate metabolism. Short-term exposure of embryos to increased temperature between days 16 and 18 of incubation directly influences the proliferation and differentiation of muscle fibres, which manifest themselves in increased hyperplasia. Ultraviolet radiation is an effective means for disinfection of hatching eggs, resulting in a change of embryonic mortality rate during breeding. Especially, green light influences both body weight and the satellite cell number in the first days posthatch, thereby enhancing the growth of embryos, and causing a significant increase in both muscle and body weight. In ovo green stimulation probably enhances the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, subsequently causing an increase in muscle weight.

Rough strains may exhibit increased airway-colonizing capacity, the cause of which remains to be determined. Examination by PFGE of consecutive isolates from the same patient showed that they all represented a single strain, even in cases where both smooth and rough isolates were present. When PFGE patterns were compared, it was shown that 24 patients had unique strains, while four patients harbored strains indistinguishable by PFGE. Two of these were siblings with CF. The other two patients, one of whom had CF, had not had contact with each other or with the siblings.

In particular, it is known in the case of vertebrate striated muscle thick filaments that the myosin head array in resting muscle is not perfectly helical but contains periodic perturbations. We show by analysis of low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns from resting bony fish muscle that any radial, azimuthal, and axial perturbations of the myosin head origins on the filament surface (due to perturbed myosin rod packing) must all be rather small and that the main perturbations are in the myosin head configurations (i.e., tilts, slews, rotations) on those origins. We provide evidence that the likely arrangement of titin molecules on the myosin filament is with them aligned parallel to the filament long axis, rather than following helical tracks. We also show from freeze-fracture studies of fish muscle that the myosin filament backbone (including titin and other extra proteins) has a radius of about 65-75 A and appears to contain a small (approximately 15-20 A radius) hollow core.

Our analyses at postnatal day 13 have revealed that Tk2-/- heart significantly increases mitochondrial transcript levels relative to the mtDNA content. This transcriptional compensation allows the heart to maintain normal levels of mtDNA-encoded proteins. The up-regulation in mitochondrial transcripts is not due to increased expression of the master mitochondrial biogenesis regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2, or to enhanced expression of the mitochondrial transcription factors A, B1 or B2.

We analyze the published literature and present preliminary data on turtle (<jats:italic>Emys orbicularis</jats:italic>) and bat (<jats:italic>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</jats:italic>) limb development. Teleosts, marsupials, and some urodeles show extreme timing differences between forelimb (or pectoral fin) and hind limb (or pelvic fin) development; this heterochrony may, in some cases, be adaptive. Published data on limb chondrogenesis reveal sequence elements that are strongly conserved (possibly owing to constraints); and others that vary between higher taxa (for unknown reasons). We find little evidence that chondrogenic sequences are modified by selection for limb functional traits. There are a few examples of developmental mechanisms that may be modified under heterochrony to produce adaptive changes in the limb (e.g. some cases of hyperphalangy or limb reduction). In conclusion, numerous examples of limb heterochrony have been recorded. However, few cases are obviously adaptive.

It results in progressive degeneration and death of upper and lower motor neurons, protein aggregation, severe muscle atrophy and respiratory insufficiency. Median survival with ALS is between 2 and 5 years from the onset of symptoms. ALS manifests as either familial ALS (FALS) (~10% of cases) or sporadic ALS (SALS), (~90% of cases). Mutations in the copper/zinc (CuZn) superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene account for ~20% of FALS cases and the mutant SOD1 mouse model has been used extensively to help understand the ALS pathology. As the precise mechanisms causing ALS are not well understood there is presently no cure. Recent evidence suggests that motor neuron degradation may involve a cell non-autonomous phenomenon involving numerous cell types within various tissues. Skeletal muscle is now considered as an important tissue involved in the pathogenesis of ALS by activating a retrograde signaling cascade that degrades motor neurons. Skeletal muscle heath and function are regulated by numerous factors including satellite cells, mitochondria and microRNAs. Studies demonstrate that in ALS these factors show various levels of dysregulation within the skeletal muscle.

Unfortunately, due to ethical concerns and lack of available primary patient-derived human cardiac tissue, combined with the minimal proliferation of CMs, the sourcing of viable human CMs has been a limiting step for cardiac tissue engineering. To this end, most research has transitioned toward cardiac differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as the primary source of human CMs, resulting in the wide incorporation of hiPSC-CMs within in vitro assays for cardiac tissue modeling. Here in this work, we demonstrate a protocol for developing a 3D mature stem cell-derived human cardiac tissue within a microfluidic device. We specifically explain and visually demonstrate the production of a 3D in vitro anisotropic cardiac tissue-on-a-chip model from hiPSC-derived CMs. We primarily describe a purification protocol to select for CMs, the co-culture of cells with a defined ratio via mixing CMs with human CFs (hCFs), and suspension of this co-culture within the collagen-based hydrogel.

Both primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains with CCR5 as the exclusive entry coreceptor (R5 viruses) efficiently replicated in Th1, Th2, and Th0 cells.

Thus, R5 HIVs show a replicative advantage in comparison to X4 viruses in their ability to efficiently propagate among suboptimally activated T lymphocytes, regardless of their polarized or unpolarized functional profiles.

The <jats:italic>Aldh1a1</jats:italic><jats:sup>\u2212/\u2212</jats:sup> mice displayed a lean phenotype compared to wild type (WT), even on a high\u2010fat (HF) diet (300days). While subcutaneous fat remained similar in WT males and females, it was reduced in the <jats:italic>Aldh1a1</jats:italic><jats:sup>\u2212/\u2212</jats:sup> mice. Strikingly, only <jats:italic>Aldh1a1</jats:italic><jats:sup>\u2212/\u2212</jats:sup> females had significant reduction in visceral fat mass (12.3\u2010fold lower than WT females), while visceral fat reduction in <jats:italic>Aldh1a1</jats:italic><jats:sup>\u2212/\u2212</jats:sup> males was insignificant (2.3\u2010fold) compared to WT males. We found markedly higher protein levels (compared to WT) of adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) in <jats:italic>Aldh1a1</jats:italic><jats:sup>\u2212/\u2212</jats:sup> females vs. males. Consistant with Atgl's key role in lipolysis, visceral fat in <jats:italic>Aldh1a1</jats:italic><jats:sup>\u2212/\u2212</jats:sup> female, but not male mice has Atgl\u2010positive staining in clusters of multilocular cells, also co\u2010expressing thermogenic proteins. The effective induction of Atgl protein levels was proven to be mediated by Rald. Altogether, our data suggest that Aldh1 could be a crucial target for treating female visceral obesity.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold><jats:italic>Grant Funding Source</jats:italic></jats:bold> <jats:italic>: The EHE SEED Grant, The Ohio State University</jats:italic></jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2012-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.801357E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A Kinesin-like Motor Inhibits Microtubule Dynamic Instability"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "A kinesin-like motor inhibits microtubule dynamic instability."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a kinesin like motor inhibits microtubule dynamic instability"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>             The motility of molecular motors and the dynamic instability of microtubules are key dynamic processes for mitotic spindle assembly and function.

BAs activate multiple signaling pathways, including those of nuclear receptors, primarily farnesoid X receptor (FXR), membrane BA receptors, and FXR-induced FGF19 to regulate the fed-state metabolism. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) has been implicated as a key mediator of these BA signaling pathways by recruitment of chromatin modifying proteins, but the key question of how SHP transduces BA signaling into repressive histone modifications at liver metabolic genes remains unknown. Here we show that protein kinase C\u03b6 (PKC\u03b6) is activated by BA or FGF19 and phosphorylates SHP at Thr-55 and that Thr-55 phosphorylation is critical for the epigenomic coordinator functions of SHP. PKC\u03b6 is coimmunopreciptitated with SHP and both are recruited to SHP target genes after bile acid or FGF19 treatment. Activated phosphorylated PKC\u03b6 and phosphorylated SHP are predominantly located in the nucleus after FGF19 treatment. Phosphorylation at Thr-55 is required for subsequent methylation at Arg-57, a naturally occurring mutation site in metabolic syndrome patients. Thr-55 phosphorylation increases interaction of SHP with chromatin modifiers and their occupancy at selective BA-responsive genes. This molecular cascade leads to repressive modifications of histones at metabolic target genes, and consequently, decreased BA pools and hepatic triglyceride levels. Remarkably, mutation of Thr-55 attenuates these SHP-mediated epigenomic and metabolic effects.

Although HSC numbers increase with age in both mice and humans, this cannot compensate for functional defects of aged HSCs. The underlying mechanisms regarding HSC aging have been studied from various perspectives, but the exact molecular events remain unclear. Several cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors contribute to HSC aging including DNA damage responses, reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered epigenetic profiling, polarity, metabolic alterations, impaired autophagy, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, nuclear factor- (NF-) \u03baB pathway, mTOR pathway, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) pathway, and wingless-related integration site (Wnt) pathway.

A distributed and intense pigment formation may be necessary to achieve the black noses of many dog breeds and wild canids, as well as dark footpads despite heavy abrasion and rapid skin renewal.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2018-06-06"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9086524E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.4838328E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.2592", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Basolateral membrane Cl- and K+ conductances of the dark-adapted chick retinal pigment epithelium"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Basolateral membrane Cl- and K+ conductances of the dark-adapted chick retinal pigment epithelium."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "basolateral membrane cl and k conductances of the dark adapted chick retinal pigment epithelium"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p> 1. We characterized the basolateral membrane Cl- and K+ conductances of the dark-adapted chick neural retina-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-choroid preparation. Conventional microelectrodes were used to measure apical (V(ap)) and basolateral (Vba) membrane voltage, and double-barreled Cl- and K+ selective microelectrodes were used to follow the time course and magnitude of ion concentration changes outside the basolateral (basal) membrane. 2. In response to a fivefold decrease in basal [Cl-]o, Vba rapidly depolarized by 6.4 +/- 0.7 (SE) mV, and the apparent resistance of the basolateral membrane (Rba) increased. The Cl- channel blocker 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) suppressed the Vba depolarization by 40% and blocked the Rba increase. Estimates of the relative Cl- conductance (transference number, TCl) from the DIDS-sensitive component of the Cl- diffusion potential gave an average value for TCl of 0.22 +/- 0.03. 3. Further evidence for a Cl- conductance was obtained by measuring changes in intracellular Cl- activity (aCli) induced by transtissue current. Depolarizing Vba elevated aiCl, whereas hyperpolarizing Vba had the opposite effect, consistent with conductive Cl- movement across the basal membrane. TCl estimated from these data averaged 0.23 +/- 0.02. 4. In response to a sixfold increase in basal [K+]o, Vba depolarized 6.1 +/- 0.8 mV. The amplitude of this K+ diffusion potential was inhibited 44 and 67% by 5 and 10 mM Ba2+, respectively. TK was estimated to be 0.61 +/- 0.05. 5. The rapid c-wave membrane hyperpolarizations in response to the light-evoked decrease in subretinal [K+]o were used to calculate the equivalent resistances of the apical membrane (R(ap)), basolateral membrane (Rba), and the paracellular shunt pathway (Rs). They were 152 +/- 10, 615 +/- 38, and 138 +/- 7 omega.cm2 (n = 11 tissues), respectively. From these data the equivalent electromotive force for the basal (Eba) and apical (Eap) membranes were estimated to be -45 +/- 2 and -77 +/- 1 mV, respectively. This estimate of Eba is in the range of that predicted from our estimates of TCl and TK, indicating that, in the dark-adapted chick retina, the resting conductance of the basal membrane can largely be accounted for by the Cl- and K+ conductances described here. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1993-10-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.779234E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.8623673E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "26", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "2.5557046", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "6", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Actitud de los consumidores frente a los productos c\u00e1rnicos con un menor contenido en sodio"}, {"@classid": "subtitle", "@classname": "subtitle", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Consumer attitude towards low salt meat products"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "actitud de los consumidores frente a los productos carnicos con un menor contenido en sodio"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p> Food choice and food purchase are complex phenomena influenced not only by the sensorial char acteristics of the product and its price, but also by other factors such as consumer attitudes towards the product.

A 48-item questionnaire was completed in by 112 consumers representing different sociodemographic levels.

Perceived control was the most important aspect in explaining the behavioral intention of the consumers despite its relatively low consistency. Attitude and the subjective norm also had a significant effect on intention. Sociodemographic parameters clearly divided the consumers in several components of the model, the sex of the individuals being the most important aspect. The predictive ability of the model was clearly different depending on whether separation of the consumers by sex and indirect measures of attitude and subjective norm were taken into account.

Since 1980s infections with enterococci resistant to numerous antibiotics have been observed with increasing frequency. There are two independent ways of developing resistance to vancomycin, connected with the common use of vancomycin for MRSA treatment and the non-medical use of this antibiotic. Nine phenotypes of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains can be distinguished: VanA, VanB, VanC, VanD, VanE, VanG, VanL, VanM, VanN. These phenotypes differ at the molecular level to a different extent. Current treatments of enterococcal infections usually include drugs such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and chloramphenicol.

The temporary nature of the therapy-induced immune response can be attributed to tumor immune evasion mechanisms, mainly the effect of suppressive immune cells and, in particular, regulatory T cells (Treg). Although the depletion of Tregs has been shown to be effective in enhancing immune responses, selective depletion of these suppressive cells without affecting other immune cells has not been very successful, and new agents are sought. We found that PI3K\u2013Akt pathway inhibitors selectively inhibit Tregs with minimal effect on conventional T cells (Tconv). Our results clearly show selective in vitro inhibition of activation (as represented by a decrease in downstream signaling) and proliferation of Tregs in comparison with Tconvs when treated with different Akt and PI3K inhibitors. This effect has been observed in both human and murine CD4 T cells. In vivo treatment with these inhibitors resulted in a significant and selective reduction in Tregs in both na\u00efve and tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, these PI3K\u2013Akt inhibitors led to a significant therapeutic antitumor effect, which was shown to be Treg dependent. Here, we report the use of PI3K\u2013Akt pathway inhibitors as potent agents for the selective depletion of suppressive Tregs. We show that these inhibitors are able to enhance the antitumor immune response and are therefore promising clinical reagents for Treg depletion.

Here, the distribution and structure of the genetic variation of S. alterniflora in Japan were examined using chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and microsatellite genotyping analyses for clarifying its invasion route and process.

We identified enhancer binding motifs surrounding the 5\u2019 splice site and hidden elements of a cryptic polyadenylation signal. Based on these structural profiles, we generated RNA therapies that interact with structural elements to unravel the hidden polyadenylation signal with the potential to activate expression of the short therapeutic isoform. In this project, we cloned these therapies into our therapeutic delivery platform and tested their efficacy to alter EGFR gene expression in tissue culture cells.

To address the need for novel selective ligands, we synthesized two compounds potentially having FFA2 activity and examined the molecular basis of their function. These compounds were confirmed to be potent and selective orthosteric FFA2 agonists. A combination of ligand structure-activity relationship, pharmacological analysis, homology modeling, species ortholog comparisons, and mutagenesis studies were then employed to define the molecular basis of selectivity and function of these ligands. From this, we identified key residues within both extracellular loop 2 and the transmembrane domain regions of FFA2 critical for ligand function. One of these ligands was active with reasonable potency at rodent orthologs of FFA2 and demonstrated the role of FFA2 in inhibition of lipolysis and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in murine-derived 3T3-L1 and STC-1 cell lines, respectively.

Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) plays an important role in the regulation of inflammatory mediators and correlates with lung function and COPD exacerbations. The objective of this work was to explore the anti-inflammatory effect and preliminary pathways of nucleosides from cultured C. sinensis on RAW264.7 macrophages and COPD mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nucleosides were extracted from cultured C. sinensis powder and further purified by macroporous resin D101 and glucan G10 columns. Inflammation and oxidative stress models in RAW264.7 macrophages and in mice were established by injection of cigarette smoke extract (CSE). We then examined how the isolated nucleosides regulated the production of the associated inflammatory mediators in vitro and in vivo by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot. RESULTS: The nucleosides inhibited inflammatory mediator expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2, and nitric oxide in both the CSE-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and mice. Moreover, the nucleosides elevated SIRT1 activation and suppressed nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)/p65 activation in vitro and in vivo. Nucleoside treatment significantly decreased the levels of the inflammatory mediators in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum of the CSE-induced mice. The nucleosides also altered the recruitment of inflammatory cells in BALF and improved characteristic features of the lungs in the CSE-induced mice.

Since some opiates are thought  to act at NMDA receptors, we also tested whether NMDA receptor  agonists and antagonists influence ocular growth or FDM.

The NMDA receptor antagonists dextromethorphan,  MK801, and AP5 also suppressed FDM. A single toxic dose  of NMDA, that destroys many subtypes of amacrine cells  (including those that synthesize the opioid peptide enkephalin),  induced myopia and ocular enlargement in ungoggled eyes,  and eliminated the ability of form-deprivation to enhance  ocular growth. The NR-1 subunit of the NMDA receptor was  localized to a narrowly stratified, intense stratum at  approximately 50% depth in the inner plexiform layer, diffusely  throughout the proximal inner plexiform layer, and to many  somata in the amacrine and ganglion cell layers. These  observations suggest that most effects of opiate receptor  ligands on FDM in the chick are mediated by non-opiate  receptors, which are likely to include NMDA receptors.  NMDA as an excitotoxin transiently enhances ocular growth,  but thereafter disables retinal mechanisms that promote  emmetropization and FDM.

As such, COX is tightly regulated through numerous mechanisms including protein\u2013protein interactions. The twin CX9C family of proteins has recently been shown to be involved in COX regulation by assisting with complex assembly, biogenesis, and activity. The twin CX9C motif allows for the import of these proteins into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria using the redox import machinery of Mia40/CHCHD4. Studies have shown that knockdown of the proteins discussed in this review results in decreased or completely deficient aerobic respiration in experimental models ranging from yeast to human cells, as the proteins are conserved across species. This article highlights and discusses the importance of COX regulation by twin CX9C proteins in the mitochondria via COX assembly and control of its activity through protein\u2013protein interactions, which is further modulated by cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, select members of the CX9C protein family, including MNRR1 and CHCHD10, show a novel feature in that they not only localize to the mitochondria but also to the nucleus, where they mediate oxygen- and stress-induced transcriptional regulation, opening a new view of mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk and its involvement in human disease.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-01-20"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.1239278E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.3578338E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "12", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "7.312", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "12", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Isolation and characterization of buffalo (&lt;i&gt;bubalus bubalis&lt;/i&gt;) amniotic mesenchymal stem cells derived from amnion from the first trimester pregnancy"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Isolation and characterization of buffalo (bubalus bubalis) amniotic mesenchymal stem cells derived from amnion from the first trimester pregnancy."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Isolation and characterization of buffalo (bubalus bubalis) amniotic mesenchymal stem cells derived from amnion from the first trimester pregnancy"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "isolation and characterization of buffalo bubalus bubalis amniotic mesenchymal stem cells derived from amnion from the first trimester pregnancy"}], "abstract": {"$": "Amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) from livestock are valuable resources for animal reproduction and veterinary therapeutic.

A crucial feature of metastatic cancers is their propensity to lose adhesion to the underlying basement membrane as they transition to a motile phenotype and invade surrounding tissue. Attachment to the extracellular matrix is mediated by a complex of adhesion proteins, including integrins, signaling molecules, actin and actin-binding proteins, and scaffolding proteins. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is pivotal for the organization of focal contacts and maturation into focal adhesions, and disruption of this process is a hallmark of early cancer invasive potential. Our recent work has revealed that myoferlin (MYOF) mediates breast tumor cell motility and invasive phenotype. In this study we demonstrate that noninvasive breast cancer cell lines exhibit increased cell-substrate adhesion and that silencing of MYOF using RNAi in the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 also enhances cell-substrate adhesion. In addition, we detected elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (FAK<jats:sup>Y397</jats:sup>) and paxillin (PAX<jats:sup>Y118</jats:sup>), markers of focal adhesion protein activation. Morphometric analysis of PAX expression revealed that RNAi-mediated depletion of MYOF resulted in larger, more elongated focal adhesions, in contrast to cells transduced with a control virus (MDA-231<jats:sup>LVC</jats:sup> cells), which exhibited smaller focal contacts. Finally, MYOF silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a more elaborate ventral cytoskeletal structure near focal adhesions, typified by pronounced actin stress fibers.

Permeabilization of nuclei from quiescent Xenopus liver or cultured Xenopus epithelial A6 cells did not facilitate efficient replication in egg extracts. Moreover, replication of Xenopus sperm chromatin in egg extracts was strongly inhibited by a soluble extract of isolated Xenopus liver nuclei; in contrast, complementary-strand synthesis on single-stranded DNA templates in egg extracts was not affected. Inhibition was specific to endogenous molecules localized preferentially in quiescent as opposed to proliferating cell nuclei, and was not due to suppression of cdk2 kinase activity. Extracts of Xenopus liver nuclei also inhibited growth of sperm nuclei formed in egg extracts. However, the rate and extent of decondensation of sperm chromatin in egg extracts were not affected. The formation of prereplication centers detected by anti-RP-A antibody was not affected by extracts of liver nuclei, but formation of active replication foci was blocked by the same extracts. Inhibition of DNA replication was alleviated when liver nuclear extracts were added to metaphase egg extracts before or immediately after Ca++ ion-induced transition to interphase. A plausible interpretation of our data is that endogenous inhibitors of DNA replication play an important role in establishing and maintaining a quiescent state in Xenopus cells, both in vivo and in cultured cells, perhaps by negatively regulating positive modulators of the replication machinery.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1996-06-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.31132E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.024636E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "8", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "6.579635E-5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cells Cultured as 3D Spheroids"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells cultured as 3D spheroids."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "trail mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells cultured as 3d spheroids"}], "abstract": {"$": "TNF-alpha-related-apoptosis-inducing-ligand (TRAIL) has been explored as a therapeutic drug to kill cancer cells.

The homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions in a tumor are known to play a crucial role in bestowing important characteristics to cancer cells that leave the primary site. Spheroid cell culture has been extensively used to mimic these physiologically relevant interactions. In this work, we show that the breast cancer cell lines BT20 and MCF7, cultured as 3D tumor spheroids, are more resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by downregulating the expression of death receptors (DR4 and DR5) that initiate TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. For comparison, we also investigated the effect of TRAIL on cells cultured as a 2D monolayer. Our results indicate that tumor spheroids are enriched for CD44hiCD24loALDH1hi cells, a phenotype that is predominantly known to be a marker for breast cancer stem cells. Furthermore, we attribute the TRAIL-resistance and cancer stem cell phenotype observed in tumor spheroids to the upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE\u2082) pathway. We show that inhibition of the COX-2/PGE\u2082 pathway by treating tumor spheroids with NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, reverses the TRAIL-resistance and decreases the incidence of a CD44hiCD24lo population.

In this study, we focused and analyzed the expression and epigenetic alteration of DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT) genes in TGCT tissues. The examined genes included DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B that function to maintain or generate a methylation status of genomic DNA. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we found that the expression of DNMT3A, but not DNMT1 or DNMT3B, was up-regulated markedly in TGCT specimens compared to non-tumor testicular tissues. To explore mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of DNMT3A, we examined the methylation status of CpGs in the gene. The distal and proximal promoter regions of DNMT3A were non-methylated in both TGCT and non-tumor tissues. In contrast, non-tumor testicular tissues exhibited a mixture of methylated and non-methylated CpGs in intron 25 of DNMT3A, whereas most CpGs in intron 25 were demethylated in TGCT specimens. This difference in the degree of methylation was confirmed by Southern blot analysis, in which an EcoRI site in intron 25 could be digested only when the CpG was non-methylated. Thus, epigenetic alteration of intron 25 toward de-methylation is associated with increased expression of DNMT3A in TGCT.

We have isolated the DNA from ten tumor tissues and their adjacent normal tissue from four different tumor types; ovarian, breast, colon and cervical. By utilizing a combination of bisulfite sequencing, SNP genotyping, and expression analysis, we show that there are distinct patterns of methylation levels between different regions of the VDR gene in each of the cancers observed. We have also analyzed a number of SNPs within these genes and show a possible correlation with the methylation and /or expression of the genes and the SNP genotypes.

In agreement with previous studies, nitrate was the least effective inhibitor of cell growth, and nitric oxide the most effective. Nitrite reductase activity was very low in C. sporogenes, indicating that the presence of external reducing agents would be necessary for the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide. Inhibition by nitrite was enhanced by ascorbate; 0.5 mM-nitrite with 10 mM-ascorbate stopped growth completely. In partially-purified preparations 4.1 mM-NaNO2 and equimolar ascorbate caused complete inactivation of hydrogenase activity but only partial (up to 78%) inactivation of pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. This agreed with the loss of hydrogen production observed with nitrite in vivo. Inhibition occurred within 5 min, and was irreversible in each case. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy showed that paramagnetic [Fe(NO)2(SR)2] species were formed during growth in the presence of nitrite, and were associated with cells.

PTHrP (1\u201336) (100 \u03bcg/kg, every other day) or vehicle was administered to mice for 13 d starting 1 wk before marrow ablation.

Moreover, a decrease in matrix mineralization occurred in ex vivo bone marrow cultures from the unablated tibia from diabetic mice. These skeletal alterations were associated with decreased gene expression (by real-time PCR) of Runx2, osterix, osteocalcin, PTHrP, the PTH type 1 receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors, and osteoprotegerin to receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand mRNA ratio, and increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b32 mRNA levels.

Finally the resistance against carbapemens e.g. imipenem originally restricted to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, then to Acinetobacter baumannii and finally to enterobacteria is related to production of novel enzymes (classes B, D and A) denominated IMP, VIM SME, GIM, OXA, KPC. A striking exemple of evolution towards more and more resistance is given by Salmonella, even from animal origins, a great threat fo public health. So far it appears necessary to perform molecular approaches to identify such enzymatic production.

Whereas wild-type C57BL/6 mice controlled parasite replication, NF-\u03baB1 knockout (KO) mice were susceptible to infection, developing chronic unresolving lesions associated with persistent parasites. There was a profound defect in Ag-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 production in infected KO mice, although innate responses\u2014including IL-12 production and control of intracellular parasite replication by macrophages\u2014were intact. In vitro polyclonal stimulation of purified naive KO T cells revealed an intrinsic defect in CD4+ T cell proliferation associated with reduced IL-2 receptor expression, but operating independently of APC function and IL-2 production. Critically, the frequency of proliferating KO CD4+ T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 matched that of wild-type cells, suggesting that NF-\u03baB1 was not required for efficient transcription of the IFN-\u03b3 gene. Taken together, these results identify a novel role for NF-\u03baB1 in CD4+ T cell proliferation and the development of Th1 cell responses required for protective immunity against intracellular pathogens.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2003-02-15"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.3218656E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.5410415E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "52", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.5544736", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "25", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Identification of reduced host transcriptomic signatures for tuberculosis and digital PCR-based validation and quantification"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "identification of reduced host transcriptomic signatures for tuberculosis and digital pcr based validation and quantification"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recently, host whole blood gene expression signatures have been identified for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB).

Using a combination of in vitro approaches, we first show that TCF7L2 protein is increased during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and primary adipocyte stem cells and that TCF7L2 expression is required for the regulation of Wnt signaling during adipogenesis. Inactivation of TCF7L2 protein by removing the high-mobility group (HMG)-box DNA binding domain in mature adipocytes in vivo leads to whole-body glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance.

We found earlier that over-expression of bcl-2 in a human breast-cancer cell line (MCF7(ADR)) enhances its tumorigenicity and metastatic potential by inducing metastasis-associated properties such as increased secretion of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9). In the present study, we investigated the effect of bcl-2 over-expression on the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, an important regulator of genes involved in tumor progression and invasion. Transient transfection experiments indicate that over-expression of bcl-2 in the MCF7(ADR) cell line, enhances NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity. Mobility-shift analysis revealed an increase of NF-kappaB DNA-binding in bcl-2-over-expressing clones that correlated with lower levels of the NF-kappaB cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaBalpha. Moreover, point mutations of 2 highly conserved residues within the BH1 and BH2 domains that abrogate the interaction of bcl-2 with bax, or deletion of the N-terminal BH4 domain, completely eliminate the ability of this molecule to up-regulate NF-kappaB-dependent transactivation. Since mmp-9 is a NF-kappaB-regulated gene, we also investigated whether bcl-2 over-expression up-regulated mmp-9 transcription. We found that induction of mmp-9 mRNA correlates with the activation of an mmp-9-promoter-reporter-gene construct in transient transfection assay, and a mutation of the (-600)mmp-9-NF-kappaB binding element abolishes this effect.

Oct3/4 (hereafter referred to as Oct4), in particular, has been an irreplaceable factor in the induction of pluripotency in adult cells. Proteins interacting with Oct4 and Nanog have been identified via affinity purification and mass spectrometry. These data, together with iterative purifications of interacting proteins allowed a protein interaction network to be constructed. The network currently includes 77 transcription factors, all of which are interconnected in one network. In-depth studies of some of these transcription factors show that they all recruit the NuRD complex. Hence, transcription factor clustering and chromosomal remodeling are key mechanism used by embryonic stem cells.

Symptoms included vascular and cortical browning, necrosis, and death of seed stalks. Isolations were made from the edge of stalk lesions and the crown. In addition to Fusarium oxysporum, the known cause of stalk blight (2), two isolates of F. solani were identified by morphology. For pathogenicity tests, sugar beet plants (FC606 [4]), grown in pasteurized potting mix and induced to flower by exposure at 4 to 7\u00b0C for 90 days (1) were used. Bolting plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 24 to 27\u00b0C. A 100-\u03bcl drop of a spore suspension (10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> spores per ml) of each Fusarium isolate was placed on the surface of the seed stalk. The plant was stabbed through the drop with a sterile 18-gauge needle so that the drop was taken into the plant by hygroscopic pressure. Positive and negative control treatments were a stalk blight isolate of F. oxysporum from an Oregon seed production field and sterile water, respectively. Three plants were inoculated per isolate. Each inoculation site was wrapped loosely in Parafilm for 1 week to maintain a high humidity level around the site of inoculation, and seed stalks were covered in cloth bags (1). After 1 week, the Parafilm was removed and plants were examined weekly for symptoms. At 4 weeks, lesion size was measured. After 5 weeks, sections were taken from the seed stalk around the site of inoculation, surface disinfested with 0.5% NaOCl, and plated on potato dextrose agar to confirm the presence of the pathogen. The experiment was done twice. One of the two isolates of F. solani caused dark brown lesions on all inoculated seed stalks. On one plant, at 4 weeks after inoculation when the bag was being removed for observation, the seed stalk broke at the site of inoculation because of a spreading, brown lesion at the site. No lesions were observed on the water control plants. Brown lesions were observed on seed stalks inoculated with the known stalk blight isolate. Lesions were significantly (P = 0.001) larger with F. oxysporum than with F. solani when measured at 4 weeks (mean of 6.3 cm versus 2.2 cm, respectively). Lesions caused by F. solani showed a dark discoloration through the cortical tissue, as opposed to those caused by F. oxysporum, for which most of the initial discoloration was in the vascular bundles and epidermis. Fusarium isolates recovered from inoculated plants were morphologically similar to the isolates used for inoculation. Fusarium spp. were not isolated from the water control plants. While some F. solani isolates cause seedling or mature root disease in sugar beet (3), to our knowledge, this is the first report of a Fusarium species other than F. oxysporum causing a rot of sugar beet stalks. </jats:p><jats:p> References: (1) E.

Comparison of the different biological and biochemical properties of isolates of this virus with those of a coyote street rabies virus (COSRV) revealed that there are unique features associated with SHBRV. In vitro studies showed that, while the susceptibility of neuroblastoma cells to infection by both viruses was similar, the infectivity of SHBRV was much higher than that of COSRV in fibroblasts (BHK-21) and epithelial cells (MA-104), particularly when these cells were kept at 34 degrees C. At this temperature, low pH-dependent fusion and cell-to-cell spread of virus is seen in BHK-21 cells infected with SHBRV but not with COSRV. It appears that SHBRV may possess an unique cellular tropism and the ability to replicate at lower temperature, allowing a more effective local replication in the dermis. This hypothesis is supported by in vivo results which showed that while SHBRV is less neurovirulent than COSRV when administered via the intramuscular or intranasal routes, both viruses are equally neuroinvasive if injected intracranially or intradermally. Consistent with the above findings, the amino acid sequences of the glycoproteins of SHBRV and COSRV were found to have substantial differences, particularly in the region that contains the putative toxic loop, which are reflected in marked differences in their antigenic composition.

Early diagnosis of MR mycoplasmal pneumonia is crucial for the best management of these patients and obviates the need for extensive etiological searches of these nonresponding cases."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2013-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.095814E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.3339279E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "36", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "9.325648", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy of Pure Pigment Gallstones"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Infrared absorption spectroscopy of pure pigment gallstones."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "infrared absorption spectroscopy of pure pigment gallstones"}], "abstract": {"$": "Pure pigment stones, a minor variety of gallstones characterized by black appearance, were analyzed by infrared absorption spectroscopy. The spectra of these stones resembled those of calcium bilirubinate in position of respective absorption bands, but they were smoother in general aspect than spectra of usual calcium bilirubinate stones. From this and other findings the main constitutents of the black stones have been identified as polymers of bilirubin derivatives. It was also revealed spectroscopically that the stones were associated with carbonate and/or phosphate of calcium at an incidence of 65 percent, and that they were less commonly associated with organic bile components such as cholesterol, bile acids and fatty acids than calcium bilirubinate stones. In order to quantitate \"smoothness\" of the spectrum, the quotient Q was calculated from intensity readings at three determined positions, including 1624 cm-1 at which the absorption is due to pyrrole rings of bilirubin. The \"smoothness\" was found to correlate well with \"blackness\" of the stone, Q being less than 0.30 for 91 percent of pure pigment stones and over 0.30 for all specimens of calcium bilirubinate stone and synthetic calcium bilirubinate."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1975-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.3943886E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.1729139E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "26", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.16252565", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}]
