In this paper, a linear model is developed to describe the dimensional variation propagation of machining processes through kinematic analysis of the relationships among fixture error, datum error, machine geometric error, and the dimensional quality of the product. The developed modeling technique can handle general fixture layouts rather than being limited to a 3-2-1 layout case. The dimensional error accumulation and transformation within the multistage process are quantitatively described in this model. A systematic procedure to build the model is presented and validated. This model has great potential to be applied toward fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for complex machining processes. Note to Practitioners-Variation reduction is essential to improve process efficiency and product quality in order to gain a competitive advantage in manufacturing. Unfortunately, variation reduction presents difficult challenges, particularly for large-scale modern manufacturing processes. Due to the increasing complexity of products, modern manufacturing processes often involve multiple stations or operations. For example, multiple setups and operations are often needed in machining processes to finish the final product. When the workpiece passes through multiple stages, machining errors at each stage will be accumulated onto the workpiece and could further influence the subsequent operations. The variation accumulation and propagation pose significant challenges to final product variation analysis and reduction. This paper focuses on a systematic technique for the modeling of dimensional variation propagation in multistage machining processes. The relationship between typical process faults and product quality characteristics are established through a kinematics analysis. One salient feature of the proposed technique is that the interactions among different operations with general fixture layouts are captured systematically through the modeling of setup errors.

As molding masters suitable for microfluidic device replication require features whose dimensions are on the order of tens to hundreds of microns, the previous limitations of CNC-milling include machining tolerances that exceed 25% of the machined feature and inability to mill intersecting features. Here, we present several novel and advanced machining techniques to overcome existing limitations of a CNC-milling based approach. To achieve microfeatures with tolerances up to a factor of ten better than expected from the CNC-mill used, external calibration and measurement of the milling process was employed. To reduce the unwanted volume occurring from two intersecting features, 102 \u03bcm dia. high-density micrograin carbon endmills were used with all milling steps externally calibrated and measured. To generate masters with abutting features of different widths, keyway slots were milled into the master that could accommodate various size molding master keys. In addition to adding flexibility to the downstream embossing step, the use of keys eliminated dead-volume effects. A variety of molding masters have been machined and characterized in this work. Taken together, these approaches illustrate that conventional CNC-milling using equipment commonly found in university machine shops is a viable alternative to other more expensive master generation processes.

The RMPC framework considers the single rigid body model subject to a set of unmodeled dynamics and plans for the optimal reduced-order trajectory and ground reaction forces (GRFs). The generated optimal GRFs of the high-level RMPC are then mapped to the full-order model using a low-level nonlinear controller based on virtual constraints and QP. The proposed hierarchical control framework is employed for locomotion over rough terrains.

We consider how these measures scale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in 1, 2 and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1 dimensional case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension implies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3 being necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations under certain conditions.

We analyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion, showing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting in an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in low spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale disturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions.

The multi-robot system developed is fault tolerant and follows a complete decentralized approach. In the proposed work, the basic elements in a real time search and rescue mission such as exploration of disaster area, target and obstacle detection, path-planning to reach the target in a coordinated way and tolerance for a few possible faults are accomplished using the \u201cweights based algorithm\u201d and the prototype testing done mimics the real time scenario.

In order to position the stage with a desired accuracy, it is required to adjust the stage displacements with a closed-loop control system. Since displacement and velocity of the main stage are not measured directly in the designed nano-positioning system, some observers should be designed to estimate these state variables using data provided by measurable variables. To this end, three different observers were designed based on neural, fuzzy and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) networks. With the purpose of obtaining data for training the observer model, a reference model is required. For this reason, the mechanism was modelled in COMSOL. The results show that among the designed observers, ANFIS can estimate the system states with higher accuracy compared to the two other observers. Currently, the position of the stage in the commercial XY nano-positioners is measured using two relatively high-cost capacity sensors that need driver circuits, while based on the observation scheme proposed in this paper, the complexity and cost of the nano-positioning systems can be reduced by using strain gauge type sensors mounted on piezo-actuators."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-05-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.9673136E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.414179E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "18", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "6.59008", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "11", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "RETRACTED: Experimental investigation on the effect of laser powder bed fusion process variables on dimensional accuracy, surface roughness and cylindricity of the AlSi10Mg alloy component"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "experimental investigation on the effect of laser powder bed fusion process variables on dimensional accuracy surface roughness and cylindricity of the alsi10mg alloy component"}], "abstract": {"$": "The present study deals with the influence of laser powder bed fusion process parameters on the selected linear dimension, surface roughness and cylindricity of AlSi10Mg alloy for manufacturing of ..."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-08-19"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.0145026E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.217609E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.32", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Modeling for Control of Symmetric Aerial Vehicles Subjected to Aerodynamic Forces"}, "abstract": [{"$": "This paper participates in the development of a unified approach to the control of aerial vehicles with extended flight envelopes.

The conventional relay feedback method has several disadvantages, which include poor estimates of the process ultimate information for low-order processes, chattering of relay for noisy environments, and asymmetric relay responses for constant biases or slow drifts in the process outputs. Methods to mitigate each of the above disadvantages are available. However, a systematic method to treat all of them has not been studied yet. Here, simple relay feedback methods that resolve these problems by introducing band-pass filters in the feedback loop are proposed. The high-pass filter part in band-pass filter removes a constant bias or low frequency drift, and the low-pass filter part removes high frequency noise and high-order harmonic terms in the relay feedback oscillation, resulting better estimates of the process ultimate information. Because filters used for the proposed methods are able to reject constant biases, the process steady state gains can be estimated without disturbing the relay feedback oscillations and first order plus time delay (FOPTD) models can be obtained by combining the process steady state gains with the relay oscillation information. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2011"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2010-10-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.690817E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.0280916E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "12", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.9119928", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Push recovery control for the underactuated lower extremity exoskeleton based on improved capture point concept"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "push recovery control for the underactuated lower extremity exoskeleton based on improved capture point concept"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:sec> <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose</jats:title> <jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to use a simple method to enhance the ability of lower limb exoskeletons to restore balance under large interference conditions and to solve the problem that biped robot stability criterion cannot be fully applied to the underactuated lower limb exoskeletons.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title> <jats:p>The method used in this paper is to construct an underactuated lower extremity exoskeleton ankle joint with a torsion spring.

The system is comprised of a microcontroller interfaced with CO sensor (MQ-7) and ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) for CO concentration sampling and window state determination respectively. A third component interfaced with the controller is a DC motor, which accordingly control the window when the concentration of CO is high. A mechanism was provided to ensure that the fan in the room is ON and the window is completely open whenever CO concentration is high to ensure quick restoration of the air quality. Results from the performance evaluation of the system showed that it achieved an average response time of 6 seconds and consumed 321.62mW and 652.82mW of power during sampling and control respectively.

The optimal performance of controllers is shown to remain intact when a controller is taken off-line, for example, due to actuator and/or sensor failures. This feature circumvents the need to redesign the remaining on-line controllers for optimal failure-tolerant control.

Resolving this task involves the neural network learning algorithms based on the mathematical model of movement. The construction of such a trajectory between two specified destinations has been considered that provides for the possibility of bypassing static and dynamic obstacles. The specified trajectory is divided into several smaller parts. The possibility of restructuring when changing the position of obstacles in space has been considered. A UAC flight control algorithm has been developed, which implies training a neural network for bypassing obstacles of different sizes. To predict the development of the situation when an object moves between two specified points in space, it is proposed to use the Q-Learning algorithm. It has been shown that the smallest number of steps required for moving along a specified trajectory is 18, the largest is 273\u00a0steps. In case of distortion during data transmission, the training of the neural network makes it possible to reduce the possibility of collision with obstacles by improving the accuracy and speed of information transfer between the on-board computer and operator. A system of the video support to moving objects was modeled; dependence charts of the normalized frame size at different parameter values were built. Using the charts makes it possible to determine the function of the maneuver intensity. Existing neural network learning methods such as CNN and LSTM were compared. It has been proven that the success rate reaches 74\u00a0% when using CNN only, while it amounts to 92\u00a0% at the hybrid application of CNN+LSTM.

To take full advantage of the prior fault information, this paper proposes an enhanced SLKPCA method, called primary-auxiliary SLKPCA (PA-SLKPCA), for better incipient fault monitoring. The contribution of the proposed method includes three aspects. First, one primary-auxiliary statistical monitoring framework is designed, by which not only the normal training data are applied to develop a primary SLKPCA model, but also the prior fault data are used to build the auxiliary SLKPCA models. Second, a double-block modeling strategy is developed to construct the auxiliary SLKPCA model for each fault case, where a variable grouping strategy based on Kullback-Leibler divergence is applied to divide the process variables into the fault-relevant group and fault-independent variable group, and the sub-model is developed for each group. Third, the Bayesian inference is used to combine the statistical results of each variable group, and one weighted fusion strategy is further designed to integrate the monitoring results from the primary and auxiliary models.

The robotic autonomous luggage trolley collection is a complex system that involves object detection, localization, motion planning and control, manipulation, etc. Among these components, effective localization is essential for the robot to employ subsequent motion planning and end-effector manipulation because it can provide a correct goal position. This article explores four popular and representative localization methods for object localization in luggage trolley collection: radio frequency identification (RFID), Keypoints, ultrawideband (UWB), and Reflectors. A qualitative evaluation framework is constructed to assess performance, encompassing Localization Accuracy, Mobile Power Supplies, Coverage Area, Cost, and Scalability. Furthermore, a series of quantitative experiments concerning Localization Accuracy and Success Rate have been conducted on a real-world robotic autonomous luggage trolley collection system. The performance of various localization methods is further analyzed based on experimental results, indicating that the Keypoints method is optimally suited for indoor environments to facilitate luggage trolley collection. Significantly, these experiment results provide a valuable reference point, extending the application of indoor localization methods across diverse scenarios.

The weight limitation implies a minimal amount of sensors while autonomy, redundancy and extra capabilities require a lot of information. Motivated by the increasing computer power, the improving quality of digital imaging and the increasing performance of digital image analysis, this paper proposes \u201ccamera images\u201d as extra source of information for the guidance and situation awareness of a gps position and inertial attitude stabilized UAV helicopter. The analysis of video together with the other onboard sensor data can greatly enhance the systems overall situation awareness. Simulation and real flight tests show that intelligent analysis of the steaming images is capable of providing a huge amount of mission-relevant knowledge. Moreover, since images contain a lot of redundant information, the onboard video can partially replace other sensors and thus cope with a variety of failures of the other sensors onboard the UAV; in occurrence the magnetometer, gps and imu. However, since analysis of images only provides statistical information about just parts of the surroundings, visual observations should be used carefully. Based on the idea that as long as the system knows the certainty of its observations it can react in accordance, the uncertainties are reduced where possible using active vision and biologically inspired algorithms. The vision-based awareness algorithms can detect and track landing pads, provide guidance towards objects of interest and reconstruct 3D terrain information. They can even provide answers to survive magnetic, gps and some inertial sensor failures using only a single camera and they can provide collision avoidance reflexes to avoid fatal collisions. The proposed system features a significant increase in situation awareness for a very modest weight and cost. Combining additional capabilities with additional safety through situation awareness in a single low-cost sensor is particularly important as weight, cost and safety are dominant factors of UAV development."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2005-06-19"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.4609487E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.744852E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "27", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.3718573", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Where Should I Look?

However, the topic of reducing the programming effort required by an expert using natural modes of communication is still open. To answer this challenge, we propose an approach based on Interactive Reinforcement Learning that learns a complete collaborative assembly process. The learning approach is done in two steps. First step consists of modeling simple tasks that compose the assembly process, using task based formalism. The robotic system then uses these modeled simple tasks and proposes to the user a set of possible actions at each step of the assembly process via a GUI. The user then \"interacts\" with the robotic system by selecting an option from the given choice. The robot records the action chosen and performs it, progressing the assembly process. Thereby, the user teaches the system which task to perform when. In order to reduce the number of actions proposed, the system considers additional information such as user and robot capabilities and object affordances.

Present work posed and solved the problem on the isolation of all unproductive power consumption in the pneumatic actuator. Such power expenditures include losses due to the incompleteness of air expansion in the working cavity, losses in the dead space, losses for throttling, additional losses for the fixation of operating unit, and the losses, related to the work to eject compressed air from the exhaust cavity.  Authors designed the circuits for actuators, as well as the principles of their operation, which make it possible to maximally decrease such unproductive power consumption.  One more essential shortcoming in the pneumatic actuators with traditional circuit of throttle braking is a rather limited level of inertia load, within which the actuator remains operational.  A cardinal solution for these problems in present work is achieved due to the transition from the circuits of throttle braking, which are quite formally transferred from hydraulic drive technique, to the circuits of braking through a change in the structure of commutation connections. Due to this, it was possible for each phase of the motion of operating unit to enable the most rational commutation relations, which allowed us to attain maximum realization of the working capacity of compressed air in pneumatic actuator and to achieve the most preferable form in the transient process. The latter made it possible to substantially increase inertia loads, at which the actuator remains operational.  Pneumatic circuits based on the commercially available pneumatic equipment are proposed, which realize these principles. A mathematical model in the dimensionless form with the isolation of criteria of dynamic similarity is developed. Based on this, a region of the rational utilization of the proposed actuators is determined in the plane of criteria of dynamic similarity; and one of the problems is solved on the parametric synthesis in the form of selecting a diameter of cylinder, which provides for the work of actuators in the zone of the most effective energy saving.

This paper reviews various image-based obstacle detection techniques employed by unmanned vehicles such as Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). More than 110 papers from 23 high-impact computer science journals, which were published over the past 20 years, were reviewed. The techniques were divided into monocular and stereo. The former uses a single camera, while the latter makes use of images taken by two synchronised cameras. Monocular obstacle detection methods are discussed in appearance-based, motion-based, depth-based, and expansion-based categories. Monocular obstacle detection approaches have simple, fast, and straightforward computations. Thus, they are more suited for robots like MAVs and compact UAVs, which usually are small and have limited processing power. On the other hand, stereo-based methods use pair(s) of synchronised cameras to generate a real-time 3D map from the surrounding objects to locate the obstacles. Stereo-based approaches have been classified into Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM)-based and disparity histogram-based methods. Whether aerial or terrestrial, disparity histogram-based methods suffer from common problems: computational complexity, sensitivity to illumination changes, and the need for accurate camera calibration, especially when implemented on small robots. In addition, until recently, both monocular and stereo methods relied on conventional image processing techniques and, thus, did not meet the requirements of real-time applications. Therefore, deep learning networks have been the centre of focus in recent years to develop fast and reliable obstacle detection solutions. However, we observed that despite significant progress, deep learning techniques also face difficulties in complex and unknown environments where objects of varying types and shapes are present. The review suggests that detecting narrow and small, moving obstacles and fast obstacle detection are the most challenging problem to focus on in future studies.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2022-08-08"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.878247E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.6029214E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "44", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "35.84", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "44", "@class": "C3"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "People Tracking and Identification with a Mobile Robot"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "people tracking and identification with a mobile robot"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "People tracking and identification with a mobile robot"}], "abstract": {"$": "In this paper we present a novel and efficient solution for tracking and identifying people with a mobile robot using multisensor data fusion.

By exploiting the complex-domain characteristics of the lifted models, an internal stability analysis is contrived under a generalized Nyquist criterion in such sampled-data systems. The analysis is constructed by examining the contraposition return difference relationships between the open- and closed-loop characteristic polynomials. We would like to mention that the suggested necessary and sufficient stability conditions entail no open-loop poles distribution information, and are simply independent of the encirclement number and orientation of the Nyquist loci.

This work is motivated by three limitations of the existing works for such problem. First, although deep learning has been used for process monitoring extensively, in the majority of the existing works, the neural networks were trained in a supervised manner assuming that the normal/fault labels were available. However, this is not always the case in real applications. Thus, in this work, autoassociative neural networks are used, which are trained in an unsupervised fashion. Another limitation is that the typical dataset used for the monitoring of the Tennessee Eastman process is comprised of just a small number of data samples, which can be highly limiting for deep learning. The dataset used in this work is 500-times larger than the typically-used dataset and is large enough for deep learning. Lastly, an alternative neural network architecture, which is called parallel autoassociative neural networks, is proposed to decouple the training of different principal components. The proposed architecture is expected to address the co-adaptation issue of the fully-connected autoassociative neural networks. An extensive case study is designed and performed to evaluate the effects of the following neural network settings: neural network size, type of regularization, training objective function, and training epoch.

Pilot studies were carried out on one healthy and one poststroke participant using continuous passive motion and bilateral/bimanual therapy modes.The soft robotic digits were able to produce required range of motion and accommodate for dorsal lengthening, with trajectories of the center of rotation of the soft robotic joints in close agreement with the center of rotation of the human finger joints.The exoskeleton showed the robust performance of the robot in applying continuous passive motion and bilateral/bimanual therapy.This soft robotic exoskeleton is promising for assisting in the rehabilitation of the hand."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.647604E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.261305E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "41", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "23.64", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "29", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Selection of optimal parting line for forging in various equipments using numerical analysis"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "selection of optimal parting line for forging in various equipments using numerical analysis"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>While designing of dies for forging, one of the most important criteria which has to be considered is the selection of parting line/plane.

The main objective of this paper is to select a suitable parting line/plane, for hot forging a circular component in mechanical press and drop hammer. For studying the effect of parting line, four dies are designed with different parting lines (top parting line, bottom parting line, central parting and inverted dies) location for hot forging of an automotive component coupling flange. Two commonly used equipments (mechanical press and drop hammer) are considered for determining the effect of parting line location on load requirement which finally decides the die wear and die life. Numerical analysis is carried out with these dies using a finite element based software DEFORM-3D.

Initially, a semisynthetic cutting fluid was applied using a conventional method (i.e. overhead flood cooling), minimum quantity of cutting fluid, and pulverization. A lubricant of vegetable oil (minimum quantity of lubricant) was also applied using the minimum quantity method. Thereafter, a cutting fluid jet under high pressure (3.0\u2009MPa) was singly applied in the following regions: chip\u2013tool interface, top surface of the chip (between workpiece and chip) and tool\u2013workpiece contact. Moreover, two other methods were used: an interflow between conventional application and chip\u2013tool interface jet (combined method) and, finally, three jets simultaneously applied. In order to carry out these tests, it was necessary to set up a high-pressure system using a piston pump for generating a cutting fluid jet, a venturi for fluid application (minimum quantity of cutting fluid and minimum quantity of lubricant) and a nozzle for cutting fluid pulverization. The output variables analyzed included tool life, surface roughness, cutting tool temperature, cutting force, chip form, chip compression rate and machined specimen microstructure. Among the results, it can be observed that the tool life increases and the cutting force decreases with the application of cutting fluid jet, mainly when it is directed to the chip\u2013tool interface. Excluding the methods involving jet fluid, the conventional method seems to be more efficient than other methods of low pressure, such as minimum quantity of volume and pulverization, when considering just the cutting tool wear. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2012-12-10"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.9304426E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.648632E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "15", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "3.0805604", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Efficient mapping through exploitation of spatial dependencies"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Efficient Mapping Through Exploitation of Spatial Dependencies"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "efficient mapping through exploitation of spatial dependencies"}], "abstract": {"$": "Occupancy grid mapping algorithms assume that grid block values are independently distributed.

There were a lot of papers that reported spatial pattern formation of multiple robots, but global information was supposed to be available in their approaches. It is, however, almost impossible for a small robot to be equipped with an advanced sensing system for global information because of robot's scale and sensor. The algorism for complicated pattern formation is needed even if each robot is not so comparative. We therefore propose a gradual pattern formation algorithm, i.e., the group of robots changes their pattern to goal pattern through a simple pattern like a line or a circle.

Dimensionless constants are used to enable scaling the model to manipulators of different lengths and materials. The approach is first validated by a comparison with Finite Element Analysis, and the results show a low error in estimating the tip deflection (less than 1% of the manipulator length). A magnetically-actuated manipulator driven by an array of electromagnetic coils is used for experimental validation. The optimization for a single segment of the manipulator is performed with experimental data, with an average error of 2.2 mm in calculating the tip position. An experimental setup for a manipulator with multiple loads is created by introducing displacement constraints with fixtures connected to multi-axis force sensors. The model shows good agreement with quasi-static experiments in estimating the reaction forces and predicting the deformed shape of the manipulator.

We employ Koopman operator theory, which encapsulates nonlinear dynamics in linear models, allowing us to bridge the gap between linear and nonlinear observability notions. We propose a new algorithm to learn Koopman operator representations that capture the system dynamics while ensuring that the output performance measure is in the span of its observables. We show that a transformation of this linear, output-inclusive Koopman model renders a new minimum Koopman representation. This representation embodies only the observable portion of the nonlinear observable decomposition of the original system. A prime application of this theory is to identify genes in biological systems that correspond to specific phenotypes, the performance measure.

Methodology. The problem of multi objective synthesis of stochastic robust control by multimass electromechanical systems to satisfy various requirements for the operation of such systems in various modes under non-gausian random external disturbances solved based on the choosing of weight matrices in the robust control goal vector.The calculation of the target vector is performed based on the solution of the zero-sum vector antagonistic game. The components of the game payoff vector are variable quality indicators that are applied to the system operation in various modes.

These agents are governed by a general linear system and can only directly measure the output, instead of the state. In order to achieve the consensus goal, each agent estimates its state through a Luenberger observer, exchanges its estimated state with neighbors, and constructs the control input with the estimated states of its own and neighbors. Due to the existence of observation and process noises, only practical consensus, instead of asymptotical consensus, can be achieved in such multi-agent systems. The performance of the achieved practical consensus can be measured by the ultimate mean square deviation of the states of agents. That performance is closely related to the observation gains of the state observers and the control gains of agents. This paper proposes a method to optimize such performance with respect to the concerned observation and control gains. That method starts with a set of feasible observation and control gains and formulates a group of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Solving these LMIs gives some intermediate matrix variables. By perturbing observation and control gains, and the intermediate matrix variables, the original LMIs yield another group of LMIs, which can be solved to provide a descent direction of observation and control gains. Moving along that descent direction, observation and control gains can be improved to yield better performance and work as the starting point of the next iteration. By iteratively repeating this procedure, we can hopefully improve the consensus performance of the concerned multi-agent system.

When installed and operating within a manufacturing facility, a machine tool needs to stay in good condition for parts production. All machine tools degrade during operations, yet knowledge of that degradation is illusive; specifically, accurately detecting degradation of linear axes is a manual and time-consuming process. Thus, manufacturers need automated and efficient methods to diagnose the condition of their machine tool linear axes without disruptions to production. The Prognostics and Health Management for Smart Manufacturing Systems (PHM4SMS) project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a sensor-based method to quickly estimate the performance degradation of linear axes. The multi-sensor-based method uses data collected from a 'sensor box' to identify changes in linear and angular errors due to axis degradation; the sensor box contains inclinometers, accelerometers, and rate gyroscopes to capture this data. The sensors are expected to be cost effective with respect to savings in production losses and scrapped parts for a machine tool. Numerical simulations, based on sensor bandwidth and noise specifications, show that changes in straightness and angular errors could be known with acceptable test uncertainty ratios. If a sensor box resides on a machine tool and data is collected periodically, then the degradation of the linear axes can be determined and used for diagnostics and prognostics to help optimize maintenance, production schedules, and ultimately part quality."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2017-07-11"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.3261687E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.1527542E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.27081215", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A new controller architecture for high performance, robust, and fault-tolerant control"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a new controller architecture for high performance robust and fault tolerant control"}], "abstract": {"$": "We propose a new feedback controller architecture.

In the formation control problem, mobile agents are controlled individually such that all interagent distances remain unchanged. The control law used by each agent is designed based on the relative positions of that agent to its neighbors, sensed in its local coordinate system. When the sensing graph is rigid, it has been shown that one can design a distributed control law to guarantee the stability of the formation. However, obtaining sensing measurements is a challenge in the formation control, since these systems are always subjected to sensing constraints, such as line-of-sight requirements and power limitations. This clearly affects the rigidity of the sensing graph, thus affecting the formation. This article proposes an online distributed algorithm based on the lattice of configurations to recover the distance-based controlled formation when a failure in a sensing link causes the network to lose its rigidity. The approach is to recover the rigidity of subframeworks of the formation, i.e., the subframework established by each node and its neighbors within the sensing range, by adding new sensing links locally so as to ensure a rigid formation. This article also proposes a multilayer rigidity recovery technique using a combination of sensing and communication networks, when the lattice of configurations fails due to a lack of neighbors for an agent.

Since the mechanism itself is a redundant manipulator with link offset, its inverse kinematics is extremely difficult to solve. To address the problems that the conventional redundant manipulator inverse kinematics solution is difficult to solve analytically and the numerical algorithm requires several iterations with accumulated errors, a synthesis inverse kinematics algorithm based on the weighted minimum norm method and the joint angle parameterization method is proposed to overcome these defects. Firstly, a set of optimized joint angle approximation solutions is obtained based on the weighted least norm method of joint angle limit avoidance optimization function, and secondly, two joint variables are parameterized as known parameters in the optimized approximation solutions based on the joint angle parameterization method, and further, the analytical expressions of the remaining joint angles are derived by algebraic methods. Finally, the superiority of the inverse kinematic synthesis algorithm over the joint angle parameterization method in terms of joint motion is verified by comparing numerical examples of linear motion trajectories. Numerical simulation results show that the algorithm has the advantages of avoiding joint angle limits, high computational accuracy, no cumulative error, and the algorithm can meet the general real-time motion control requirements as demonstrated by the experimental analysis of algorithm time consumption.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-07-20"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9433622E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.1391574E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Informative Path Planning for Mobile Sensing with Reinforcement Learning"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "informative path planning for mobile sensing with reinforcement learning"}], "abstract": [{"$": "Large-scale spatial data such as air quality, thermal conditions and location signatures play a vital role in a variety of applications.

This paper proposed a graded-Q reinforcement learning with information-enhanced state encoder (GQRL-IESE) framework to address this hierarchical collaborative multi-vehicle pursuit (HCMVP) problem. In the GQRL-IESE, a cooperative graded Q scheme is proposed to facilitate the decision-making of pursuing vehicles to improve pursuing efficiency. Each pursuing vehicle further uses a deep Q network (DQN) to make decisions based on its encoded state. A coordinated Q optimizing network adjusts the individual decisions based on the current environment traffic information to obtain the global optimal action set. In addition, an information-enhanced state encoder is designed to extract critical information from multiple perspectives and uses the attention mechanism to assist each pursuing vehicle in effectively determining the target. Extensive experimental results based on SUMO indicate that the total timestep of the proposed GQRL-IESE is less than other methods on average by 47.64%, which demonstrates the excellent pursuing efficiency of the GQRL-IESE.

In order to deal with this non-linear complex system with a changing mass, further research on modelling and control must be developed. In this work, a new intelligent control strategy is proposed and applied to a quadrotor with a cable-suspended load. The UAV carrying a suspended load has two different dynamic behaviors, depending on the state of the cable. Thus, we proposed to model the complete system using the hybrid automata formalism. Using this novel UAV model approach, a hybrid control is designed based on feedback linearization controllers combined with an artificial neural network, which acts as an online estimator of the unknown mass. The suspended load is dealt with as an external disturbance. Simulation results show how the on-line learning control scheme increases the robustness of the control and it is able to stabilize the quadrotor without any information about neither the position of the load nor the tension of the cable.

We investigate two cases of the model, one with massless legs and another with infinitesimal leg masses.

In order to reduce cutting force and tool wear, researchers have attempted to fabricate microstructures on the tool by grinding, lithography, etching, and other technologies to improve lubrication condition between tools and chips. However, these processes were limited to certain conditions. In this paper, three-dimensional (3D) laminated microelectrodes were used to fabricate various microstructures on polycrystalline diamond (PCD) turning tools by micro-electrical discharge machining (micro-EDM). Moreover, microstructure-based PCD turning tools were used to perform cutting experiments on titanium alloy. During this process, the cutting force of PCD turning tools were measured by force measuring device, and chips were collected and observed. After that, the friction coefficient and tool wear of PCD tools with different microstructures were measured. The experimental results show that microstructures on the rake face of PCD turning tools can effectively reduce friction coefficient for cutting titanium alloy, thus reducing cutting force and tool wear.

The actuator is composed of two symmetrically distributed silicone rubber blocks (Ecoflex0030 from Smooth-on Co., Ltd.). Between the two rubber blocks, an ABS plate is fixed to work as a neutral layer. When one side of the actuator is inflated, it consequently bends toward the uninflated side. The deformation of the actuator on the inflated side and the uninflated side, respectively, is analyzed based on principles of elasticity mechanics. The deformation on the inflated side is simplified to planar type and is decomposed into two mutually perpendicular directions to analyze the stress state. A two-step deforming process is proposed to study the stress state on the uninflated side. The two components are combined to determine the relationship between the bending angle of the actuator and the actuating pressure. The proposed model is compared with a finite element analysis model in which the same constraint, load, and materials are used.

These properties make this material suitable for aeronautic applications, especially for hot structural components, such as blades and discs of aircraft engines in which a high dimensional accuracy and low surface roughness are required. Such manufacturing requirements in general can be achieved through the grinding process. However, due to low thermal conductivity of both the Inconel 718 alloy and the conventional abrasive grinding wheels, most of heat generated during machining concentrates on the workpiece\u2013grinding wheel interface. The usual practice for the removal of heat from grinding zone is by the application of high volume of coolants, but such technique can cause injury to the operator and harm to the environment, if special care with its use and disposal is not taken, which, in turn, increases the cost of the process. Furthermore, due to the poor machinability of Inconel 718, cutting conditions need to be different from those generally employed when grinding steels and cast irons, especially the depth of cut. Within this context, this study presents an approach for determining the grindability of Inconel 718 under different coolant delivery techniques (conventional and minimum quantity lubrication\u2014MQL) and cutting conditions. Grinding tests were also carried out on a grey cast iron material for comparison purposes. Surface roughness, microhardness and surface texture of machined surfaces were the output parameters used to access the grindability of Inconel 718. Results showed that higher values of surface roughness were recorded after grinding the Inconel 718, compared to grey cast iron, thereby indicating the lower grindability of Inconel 718.
