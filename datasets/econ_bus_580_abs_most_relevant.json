Deregulation, technology, changes in legal systems and global competition are blurring the lines that traditionally used to define the financial services markets \u2013 geography, product offerings, financial barriers, time differences and distribution channels. Instead of going to the bank or an insurance company, people are more likely to visit an automated teller machine (ATM), a kiosk, or a website, where they can also check their stock portfolio or compare insurance rates online. Faced with an increasing array of financial products and services, customers are expecting more from providers in terms of customised offerings, value, ease of access and personalised service. It is now difficult for financial institutions to differentiate their products solely based on price.

The theoretical basis includes in particular \u201ethe core-periphery theory\u201c, extended by the concept of the sectoral agglomerations and also selected theories of the period of post-Fordism. It is assumed that a strongly territorially concentrated branch that transformed into the sectoral agglomeration of identical companies in terms of the branches is specific for a range of its network externalities such as positive effects resulting from a qualified workforce, spreading innovation and transferring knowledge, experience and information. In general terms, some microeconomic factors and relevant variables will be perceived differently by ICT firms in the context of the different intensity of the sectoral concentration in the particular territory. The contribution is based on the primary research performed among ICT companies in Moravskoslezsk\u00fd Region and Jihomoravsk\u00fd Region in the Czech Republic in 2016 and 2017 expressing their attitudes and opinions in the context of the branch concentration emphasizing the specific localization of these companies within the centres of the analysed regions, or on the outside, i.e. on the periphery. The analysis of the results from the questionnaire survey is in the empirical part confronted according to the location of the firms in the centres of ICT branch concentration of the chosen regions (in Brno-city and Ostrava-city) and simultaneously compared across the two regions. Based on the performed research, it was discovered that more than 60 % of the companies perceive branch concentration positively and consider its effect beneficial and desired.

The negative implications of the \u201cresource curse\u201dare valid in the case of this country, as well. Russia has become resource-oriented despite the priority of heavy (military) industry development during the Soviet period. Although in some fields Soviet manufacturing was extensive and strong, it proved inefficient and internationally non-competitive.

Thus, the present dependence on oil and gas is more a consequence than a cause of the weakness of manufacturing.

This paper describes how this sidepath safety model was developed and how it provides important guidance for bicycle facility type selection and sidepath design. The model was developed using operational and geometric data, user counts, and crash data for 21 roadway sections throughout Florida. Four determining factors were found to be significant and are included in the model: sidepath width (possibly a surrogate for user speed), separation of the sidepath from the roadway, posted speed of the roadway, and number of lanes on the adjacent roadway. The sidepath safety model R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> value is .81. The sidepath safety model also serves to quantify some of the concerns expressed in the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities. Using this model, transportation planners and engineers will be able to test alternative design treatments to find the safest one for bicyclists. They will also be able to review existing sidepaths that have crash problems to identify potential solutions. This model provides an important new tool for transportation professionals to use when deciding on and designing bicycle facilities. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2006-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.383384E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.917476E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "22", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "2.2900453", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Editorial Comment"}, {"@classid": "subtitle", "@classname": "subtitle", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Diversification: <i>Should We Be Diversifying </i>Trends?"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "editorial comment diversification should we be diversifying trends"}], "abstract": {"$": "In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, an increase in correlations between asset classes was frequently cited as having rendered diversification strategies ineffective and, thereby, causing unexpected losses to investors.

Each crisis caused a reactionary movement towards restructuring corporate governance and policy to satiate growing stakeholder pressures to reform the system.

Specifically, we first evaluate the usefulness of this new luminosity indicator in the context of ASEAN regions. Results show that almost 60 percent of the differences in (official) GDP per capita can be predicted by this luminosity-based measure of GDP. Next, given its potential usefulness for predicting regional GDP, we evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of regional inequality across ASEAN. Results indicate that although there is an overall (average) process of regional convergence, regional inequality within most countries has not significantly decreased. When evaluating the patterns of spatial dependence, we find increasing spatial dependence over time and stable spatial clusters (hotspots and coldspots) that are located across multiple national boundaries.

This far, most knowledge management initiatives have consisted of the implementation of new IT tools allowing for more efficient information handling. This approach has been criticized, as it does not consider certain aspects of knowledge, e.g. tacitness, social embeddedness and the creation of new knowledge. Alternative knowledge management approaches based on a more comprehensive notion of knowledge have been called for, but few examples of what these could look like in practice have been given. One example of an attempt to manage knowledge in a more holistic manner is knowledge networking. Based on case studies of seven different knowledge networking initiatives within Ericsson, the key components of the overall approach are described and some of the challenges posed to management are identified. Key issues that need to be attended to when designing and implementing individual knowledge networking initiatives are the extension and focus of user groups, the role of management in the initiatives and the promotion of knowledge\u2010sharing behaviour throughout the organization. Ericsson's knowledge networking strategy aims at developing a loosely coupled structure of nuclei for knowledge creation and sharing, connected to each other by different kinds of knowledge directories. This appears to have some advantages compared to traditional knowledge management strategies, as it supports the creation and sharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge. Furthermore, its strong focus on locally developed initiatives and knowledge directories may offer a more dynamic support structure than traditional top\u2010down initiatives focusing primarily on knowledge repositories.

In Germany, however, they are getting richer: workers in the bottom decile of the male earnings distribution in Germany earn twice as much as their counterparts in the US, where real wages for the low paid have been falling since the 1980s (the position of low paid workers in Britain falling somewhere between these two.) Given that the unemployment rate of the unskilled in Germany is much the same as in the US and lower than in Britain, this paper asks what lessons might be drawn from the German experience by policy\u2010makers in Britain.

The data from 1990 were treated as a benchmark. There were 14,626 accidents in total, of which 236 (1.61%) were fatal. The non-fatal accident rate in the whole forestry industry showed a decreasing trend in the study period (t = 2.27, p &lt; 0.05). In the case of the fatal accident rate we can observe an upward trend; in the period of intensive privatization the average annual fatality rate was 0.11, and after privatization it was 0.18 (t = \u22122.68, p &lt; 0.05).

More diversified farmers are less likely to sell collectively when group marketing activities only concentrate on one particular commodity. Since smallholders are often highly diversified, the focus of farmer groups should also be broadened.

Both technical economic arguments and political economy considerations are discussed. I conclude that there is an economic case for GCC monetary union, but that it is not overwhelming. The lack of economic integration among the GCC members is striking. Without anything approaching the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons among the six GCC member countries, the case for monetary union is mainly based on the small size of all GCC members other than Saudi Arabia, and their high degree of openness. Indeed, even without the creation of a monetary union, there could be significant advantages to all GCC members, from both an economic and a security perspective, from greater economic integration, through the creation of a true common market for goods, services, capital and labour, and from deeper political integration. The political arguments against monetary union at this juncture appear overwhelming, however. The absence of effective supranational political institutions encompassing the six GCC members means that there could be no effective political accountability of the GCC central bank. The surrender of political sovereignty inherent in joining a monetary union would therefore not be perceived as legitimate by an increasingly politically sophisticated citizenry. I believe that monetary union among the GCC members will occur only as part of a broad and broadly based movement towards far-reaching political integration.

The FTA approach uses a rigid mathematical process in which 24 attributes of a proposal are scored initially and then aggregated multiple times to obtain a single overall rating for the proposal. The proposal's funding recommendation is based on this rating. In this approach, a small difference in the initial score can make a significant difference in the final score; that is, the final score is not stable with respect to small perturbations in the initial scores of the attributes. In any evaluation, there is always room for subjective judgment and associated uncertainty to enter when the score of an attribute, the break points on the scoring scale, and the value of the weights of the attributes are determined. The proposed fuzzy inference approach incorporates the fuzziness and approximation associated with the evaluation process and preserves them through the calculation process. In this study, data from the 2012 and 2013 reports of the FTA New Starts Program proposal evaluation were used to compare the FTA approach with the proposed approach. The proposed fuzzy inference approach was found to be robust in dealing with evaluator uncertainty in the initial scores.

It is therefore concluded that yachting tourism has potentially a strategic\u00a0role to play in this shift, but further investigation is needed in order to reconsider\u00a0it within alternative approaches to development through tourism.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2022-07-25"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.4913103E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Higher-Order Learning"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Higher-order learning"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "higher order learning"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We design a novel experiment to study how subjects update their beliefs about the beliefs of others.

The imperfections in the economy in the form of informational asymmetries among the agents and uncertainty in the production process necessitate financial intermediation and collateralized borrowing in the economy. The reason to abstract from money in the setup of the framework is to be able to concentrate on the real implications of increasing financial openness for the effect of technology shocks, business cycle implications of which have long been discussed in the literature.

When complying with institutional pressures, firms try to make decisions to maximize profit while minimizing the risks to them. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the institutional development level on institutional compliance timing by MNEs and the relationship between compliance speed and corporate performance.     Design/methodology \u2013 The research focuses on three main variables, which are the institutional development level (as a determination of the institutional pressure level), the firm\u2019s compliance speed (as a determination of the compliance timing), and the firm\u2019s financial performance (as a determination of the corporate performance). We collected 19,869 firm-level data from CSMAR (the China Stock Market and Accounting Research), 6,922 CSR data from RKS (the Rankins CSR Ratings), and province and city-level data from the NERIM (National Economic Research Institute Index of Marketization) and NBSC (National Bureau of Statistics of China). The firms in China were chosen for analysis, and the analysis period was from 2008 to 2017. Random Effects GLS Regression was used to test the relationships among the variables.     Findings \u2013 This study examined the effect of the institutional development level on the firm\u2019s compliance speed, together with the effect of compliance speed on the firm\u2019s financial performance of the MNEs in China. We found that the institutional development level positively influenced firms\u2019 financial performances, which means the firms\u2019 financial performances are better in the region with a high institutional development level. The compliance speed of institutional practice by firms was faster in the higher level of institutional development. However, the firm\u2019s delayed compliance led to better financial performance.     Originality/value \u2013 Studies in the resource dependence view of Institutional Theory often fall short in understanding the theory by overlooking the firm\u2019s active decision-making. Thus, the findings do not present a full scope of corporate performance in this regard. This study not only found a way to test the role of a firm\u2019s independent decision-making (i.e., compliance timing) when facing the institutional pressure but also prove the significant role of the compliance timing on corporate performance. Also, we were able to test the effect of institutional development level, controlling location-specific variables because we used CSR performance data for MNEs operating in China. Lastly, by doing the above, the findings of this study suggest practical implications to the industry practitioners in MNEs."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-06-30"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.8908647E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.825312E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.6", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Managing Oil Price Risk in Developing Countries"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "managing oil price risk in developing countries"}], "abstract": {"$": "This article presents a simple framework for understanding the impact of oil dependence on growth in terms of an optimal savings and investment strategy.

Methodology/Technique - This research uses mixed research methods. The quantitative method was used to study the influence of competitive advantage on firm performance of community enterprises, and a qualitative method was used to determine proposals to enhance competitive advantage. In Step 1, a quantitative research method was used to identify the population which includes management groups of 36 geminated parboiled rice community enterprises consisting of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and a supervisor of 208 people, and 137 samples. Proportional sampling and simple random sampling were used in this process. Data was collected using questionnaires. The statistics used for data analysis was frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, F-test (one way ANOVA), Pearson's correlation coefficient, and hierarchical regression analysis. In step 2, data was collected from in-depth interviews with key informants, using a purposive sampling method. Data analysis from the interviews using the information obtained from the interview into categories and using content analysis to determine proposals.  Findings - The research results found that competitive advantage and firm performance was high. The hypothesis testing results show that only the age of the community enterprise has an effect on the image of the community enterprise with the statistical significance of 0.05. All 3 independent variables composed of cost leadership, differentiation, and market focus had an influence on firm performance, by standardized coefficients (\u03b2) was .398, .426, .654 respectively.  Novelty - The proposals from this research include the establishment of newly geminated parboiled rice community enterprises to accelerate the creation of the organization image to be known and accepted by consumers. Further, community enterprises should focus on developing a competitive advantage that comes from a market focus strategy. This will have a positive impact on firm performance.

To motivate an empirical specification we develop a model of an industry labor market which demonstrates, under general conditions of supply and demand for labor, that tastes for discrimination will affect black-white wage differentials across industries as well as employment ratios. If labor supply curves are infinitely elastic the model clearly indicates that tastes for discrimination will affect employment alone. The assumption of an infinitely elastic labor supply curve is a convenient simplifying convention employed in a number, e.g. [2], of theoretical and empirical studies of discrimination. The validity of this assumption at the industry level can be tested empirically. Therefore the statistical analysis in our paper is designed to test the two interrelated hypotheses: (i) are labor supply curves to an industry upward sloping or infinitely elastic? and (ii) is discrimination within an industry systematically related to market power. To measure potential discrimination observed black-white wage differentials within several industries were corrected for productivity differences of black and white employees. Then, the corrected wage differentials were regressed on the industry characteristics, market concentration, percent union, and the elasticity of demand for labor. The theoretical model indicates that if labor supply curves are infinitely elastic then all of these industry characteristics should be unrelated to the corrected wage differentials. On the other hand, a significant coefficient on the elasticity of demand and percent union is persuasive evidence that labor supply curves are upward sloping. The managerial discretion hypothesis is tested by the significance of the market power variable. Our results confirm that industry labor supply curves rise with employment. Blackwhite wage differentials across industries are systematically related to industry characteristics such as percent union and the elasticity of demand for labor. The results, however, offer no support to the contention that market power and discrimination are related. The author [4] suggests that the latter result can be attributed to perfectly elastic supply curves of labor, an assertion which we have shown to be incorrect."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1980-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.2470031E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Knowledge\u2010Based System for Design of Signalized Intersections"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "knowledge based system for design of signalized intersections"}], "abstract": {"$": "For an efficient traffic operation in intelligent highway systems, traffic signals need to respond to the changes in roadway and traffic demand.

There is a pressing need to understand better the new product development process within the firm in order to appreciate why managers are rarely responsible for radical innovation. The currently fashionable portfolio approach to business management emphasises the need to administer the product mix as an integrated whole. The problem of accommodating innovative products within the firm's established product mix or portfolio is considerable in view of the need to obtain synergystic effects from the multiplicity of marketing mix components involved. The array of marketing mixes managed by the company comprises its marketing portfolio, a concept which suggests an alternative framework within which corporate innovative strategies can be understood. Analysed within this framework, several practical examples indicate that many companies seek limited, strategic innovation rather than radical new product development.

Objective: This study aims to examine the relationships between psychosocial risk factors, presenteeism, mental and physical health in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study also examines the moderating effect of company size on these associations. Methods: To test the association between psychosocial risks, presenteeism, and health, only people working in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of between 2 and 199 employees were included in the sample, giving a total of 2,525 SME employees surveyed. To test the differences in exposure to psychosocial risk and presenteeism, and the moderating impact of size on the relationship between psychosocial risks, presenteeism, and health, we took the original sample (4608) of the EQCOTESST. Results: The results confirm the associations between job demands, social support and effort-reward imbalance, and presenteeism.

In this paper, we use a Canadian dataset to revisit the risk-return trade-off associated with banks OBS activities and study the evolution of the endo-geneity of banks decision to expand their market-oriented business lines. Consistent with the changing mix of noninterest income OBS activities generate, we identify a structural break in 1997 which coincides with an increased impact of endogeneity on banks returns, and which also leads to an increased return on assets (ROA) and a surge in banking risk. We trace the sources of the greater volatility of noninterest income to a tighter cointegrating relationship between noninterest income and stock market indices after 1997. Intro-ducing a new, robust estimation method based on a modification of the Hausman procedure, we find that neglecting endogeneity greatly underestimates the positive impact of shadow banking on bank accounting returns, even when the subprime crisis is considered.

Students who prefer active educational communication, daily plan their activities on the assimilated principles.

Our identification is based on the timing of the introduction and cancellation of the policy (both its announcement and implementation), from which we infer when the effects on abortions and births can be expected. We find that the introduction of the policy led to a 3% increase in birth rates, due to both a decrease in abortions and an increase in conceptions. The announcement of the cancellation of the policy led to a transitory increase in birth rates of 4% just before the cancellation was implemented, driven by a short-term drop in abortions. The cancellation then led to a 6% drop in birth rates. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the positive fertility effect of the benefit introduction was driven by high-skilled parents, while the negative impact of the cancellation was larger among low-skilled and out-of-labor-force parents, and in lower income, higher unemployment regions.

Placebo effects that manifest as changes in subjective state (e.g., mood, aesthetic ratings) are one thing, but when the effect extends to behavior, the placebo passes out of the realm of being \u201call in the head\u201d and into something real and measurable. An examination of Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely\u2019s experiments sheds some light on the nature of these changes but also raises a host of questions about the very nature of the placebo effect and where it comes from. The idea behind Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely\u2019s experiment is simple: The more a person pays for a beverage advertised to increase mental acuity, the bigger the performanceenhancing effect should be. However, paying more for the beverage did not improve mental performance so much as paying discounted prices impaired performance. Such a result suggests that the product marketing can establish a placebo effect in terms of its efficacy that precedes the price effect. Indeed, when participants\u2019 attention was deliberately drawn to the price, the price effect was weakened, suggesting that by whatever mechanism the price effect operates, it is probably nonconscious. The only way that performance was actually enhanced beyond baseline was by drawing attention to the marketing claims surrounding the product. Only in this circumstance did paying more for the product enhance performance. As Shiv, Carmon, and Ariely suggest, the price of the product affects performance through the commonly known placebo effect. Indeed, there is no reason to doubt this, but from where does the placebo effect come? More specifically, where in the brain do placebos operate, and is it possible that price effects operate differently? Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is beginning to provide a window into how these processes function in the brain. At its core, fMRI depends on the empirical observation that blood flow increases to active parts of the brain. Although the exact mechanism by which this happens is not fully understood, because it does happen, activity states in the brain can be inferred on a fairly small spatial scale (a few millimeters) and moderate time scale (5\u201010 seconds)."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2005-11-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.1273527E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.997336E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "23", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.5710796", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Information openness in the sphere of environment protection as a factor of sustainability of machine-building companies"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "information openness in the sphere of environment protection as a factor of sustainability of machine building companies"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The research is devoted to the issues of information openness of machine-building companies in the sphere of environment protection.

First, the impact of innovativeness on fashion consumption propensity was explored. It was found that the innovativeness has impact on ostentation-seeking propensity and personality-seeking propensity. The impact of innovativeness on the clothing satisfaction was explored. It was found that the innovativeness has negative impacts on tangible value satisfaction and intangible value satisfaction. Second, it was found that if an innovative consumer has less ostentation-seeking propensity and less personality-seeking propensity, the innovative consumer gets more satisfaction from tangible value of clothes. On the other hand, if an innovative consumer has less ostentation-seeking propensity, the innovative consumer gets more satisfaction from intangible value of clothes. Third, the differences in consumer innovativeness, fashion consumption propensity and satisfaction dependent on the age of consumers were explored. In innovativeness and fashion consumption propensity, fashion-seeking propensity and personality-seeking propensity had significant differences between different age groups.

The regression function is highly significant and 34.2% of variations in dependent variable are explained by variations in independent variables. Implications: The implications are that sound awareness by the head of internal audit functions and top management are important on how the usage of BDA is going to influence the IA performance and frequent meetings and interactions between IA function and AC are necessary in the changing business and technological environment in reshaping the internal audit function. Also, furthermore, how to maximize the support of employees and top management as well as to provide more independence to internal audit should be considered.

With this aim, we focus on different sources of heterogeneity and study how the different level of heterogeneity affects the performance of GCs. Specifically, we consider the GC heterogeneity due to: 1) the variety in the firms' technological specialization; 2) the diversity in the firms' organization; 3) the variety of the external knowledge brought into the GC; 4) the absorptive capacity of the GC. We conduct an empirical research on 32 Italian District Provinces (DPs), by measuring for each DP the level of heterogeneity and the level of performance. To do this, a set of variables both for the sources of heterogeneity and for the performances has been defined. In particular, the variety in the firms' technological specialization has been measured by using two different concentration indexes: the Gini coefficient and the Theil index, both aim at capturing the level of concentration of both firms and employees in a specific manufacturing sector. The diversity in the firms' organization has been computed by using the Gini coefficient and the Theil index. In this case the indexes measure the level of concentration of both firms and employees in a specific class of employees. As for the variety of the external knowledge brought into the DP, we have evaluated the breadth of the international trade linkages of each DP. Specifically, by using the Gini coefficient, we have calculated the level of concentration of both imports and exports in a specific country of destination/origin (Boschma and Iammarino, 2009). As for the absorptive capacity, we have calculated the number of graduates in technical-scientific fields in each DP. Finally, as measures of performance, we have considered three indicators: the GDP, the number of patents developed in each DP, and the firms' death rate.

The study took place in Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, located in Ahvaz, Iran. A total of 402 insurance experts and university staffers participated in the study. A cross-sectional data collection was done using semi-structured interviews (n = 22) and a questionnaire (n = 380). The latter was validated via a panel of content area experts, criterion-dependent validity (second-order confirmatory factor analysis), and divergent validity (cross-sectional load test and Fornell-Laker). Cronbach's alpha and combined reliability were - 0.8 and 0.8, respectively. A structural equation approach was employed to analyze data using Smart PLS software.  Results: Customer loyalty with an impact factor of 0.60 and T-statistic of 5.79, profitability with an impact factor of 0.55 and T-statistic of 3.75, customer co-creation with an impact factor of 0.28, and T-statistic of 2.7 have been identified as dimensions of customer lifetime value.

Unfortunately, traffic congestion has become a critical problem in urban cities. Road traffic congestion reduces productivity in transportation services, and the daily profit earned is consequently reduced. This is opposite to the cost of living, which is increasing rapidly. Therefore, these issues are causing difficulties in all occupations in terms of managing daily expenses, particularly for taxi drivers. The taxi driving is classified as low income compared to other occupations. Such facts are a symbol of economic inefficiency. To this end, this study aims to assist taxi agencies and the government in improving taxi driver profits in Bangkok using large-scale data. To deal with these large-scale data, we propose a big data-driven model. With this model, we first calculate costs using a cost\u2013distance algorithm and trip reconstruction. The data are then modeled to understand distance-based profits with respect to the departure time and traffic conditions. Finally, several cost predictive models using machine learning are evaluated using the ground truth from 50 taxis for a 1-month period. The experiment results show that more frequent trips over a short distance yield higher profits than long-distance trips. Finally, a solution to improve taxi driver profits is determined.

Nearly 100 years after Marshall published his remarks, the received analysis of a Giffen good is almost entirely contained in the assertion that in the Slutsky equation for the \"own price\" effects on consumption of the good, the income term may be sufficiently large to outweigh the negative pure substitution term. Even the elementary question of the impact of this large income effect on the consumption of other commodities seems to have been overlooked.2 In the standard two-good (x1 and x2) world, for example, if x1 is a Giffen good, i.e., if Ox1/lp, > 0, then from the budget constraint, p1OX1/P1 +p2aX2/p1= x1 and thus ax2/ap1  O. To satisfy the budget constraint, the large negative income term for x1 must produce a large positive income effect for x2 that outweighs the net substitution term in the Slutsky equation for the effects of changes in Pi on x2. When the price of the Giffen good changes, therefore, not only does the income term outweigh the substitution term for the Giffen good, but a similar result is produced for the cross effect on the other commodity. This simple result seems to have gone unnoticed. Many economists have studied the Giffen paradox but a satisfactory analysis appears to be lacking. Marshall believed that the marginal utility of money, i, must rise with an increase in the price of the Giffen good. George Stigler asserted [1950, p. 327], that the Giffen case is inconsistent with an additively separable utility function.3 William Gramm [1970] also examined the paradox, but his interpretation was not intended to add to knowledge about the economics of the"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1984-10-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.03044E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.7731107E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "24", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.1990272", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Targeting Women\u2019s Employment: Do Employment Subsidies Work?

Using a difference-in-differences analysis, I find that those provinces saw a 5.1 percent higher increase in the female share of employment in comparison with provinces where positive discrimination was not in force. Moreover, the effectiveness of the package is not lower in more conservative provinces, where conservatism is measured by the percentage of early marriages, gender inequality, and gender empowerment indices. The study concludes that the 2008 employment package was successful in closing the gender gap, even in more conservative provinces. By showing that a demand-side intervention can overcome the cultural constraints, it offers valuable insights to policy-makers interested in pursuing policies related to disadvantaged groups, particularly women. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: C31, J08, J21, Z10 </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-06-25"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.0127771E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.4795938E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "2.792", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Climatic natural disasters, political risk, and international trade"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "climatic natural disasters political risk and international trade"}], "abstract": {"$": "This paper statistically analyzes the effects of climatic natural disasters and political risk on bilateral trade in a large-N sample of countries and years.

This appears to be rather a political or ethical question than an issue of strict economic rationality.

When KCP efficiency increases, KMPI will also expand, enabling firms to become knowledge-intensive. To prove KMPI's contribution, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 101 firms listed in the KOSDAQ market in Korea. We associated KMPI with three financial measures: stock price, price earnings ratio (PER), and R&D expenditure.

The main interest resides in the average frequency of price re-optimization by firms. We use the labor income share as the driving variable and consider a source of real rigidity by allowing for a fixed firm-specific capital stock. A GMM estimation strategy is employed as well as an identification robust method based on the Anderson\u2013Rubin statistic. We find that the German Phillips curve is purely forward-looking. Moreover, our point estimates are consistent with the view that firms re-optimize prices every 2\u20133 quarters. These estimates seem plausible from an economic point of view. But the uncertainties around these estimates are very large and also consistent with perfect nominal price rigidity, where firms never re-optimize prices. This analysis also offers some explanation as to why previous results for the German NKPC based on GMM differ considerably. First, standard GMM results are very sensitive to the way in which orthogonality conditions are formulated. Further, model mis-specifications may be left undetected by conventional  J  tests.

Research was undertaken with two objectives: ( a) to observe and identify the level of use of auxiliary through lanes added at intersections of four-lane, two-way roadways; and ( b) to study the effects of auxiliary lane length, right-turn volume, and through/right-turn lane group delay on the level of their use. Lane-use data collected during 1,050 saturated cycles at eight signalized intersections with different auxiliary lane lengths were used to accomplish research objectives.

Lane use of nearly one to seven straight-through vehicles per cycle, depending on levels of factors investigated, was observed at the study locations.

The many recurring problems and barriers that hinder the attainment of sustainable development objectives at universities are either directly or indirectly related to deficiencies in planning which pose a significant barrier to the implementation of sustainable development. There is therefore a perceived need to foster a better understanding of how planning may help higher education institutions to become more successful in implementing sustainable development. Based on this need, this paper describes the role of planning as a tool for improved knowledge and sound decision-making towards a better understanding of sustainability in a science and technology context, and the motivation towards transformation. In particular, it reports on a survey in the context of which some of the major obstacles for planning and implementing sustainable development at universities are outlined. The study identified the fact that many universities are yet to have fully developed plans to take into account matters related to sustainable development, and describes some the elements which could be considered in attempts to give a greater emphasis to sustainability to planning in a higher education context."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-10-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.070564E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.019899E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "73", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "36.21472", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "41", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "downloads", "@score": "259", "@datasource": "opendoar____::76dc611d6ebaafc66cc0879c71b5db5c||e-space at Manchester Metropolitan University"}, {"@id": "downloads", "@score": "572", "@datasource": "opendoar____::8a1e808b55fde9455cb3d8857ed88389||Bournemouth University Research Online"}, {"@id": "views", "@score": "3", "@datasource": "opendoar____::76dc611d6ebaafc66cc0879c71b5db5c||e-space at Manchester Metropolitan University"}, {"@id": "views", "@score": "5", "@datasource": "opendoar____::8a1e808b55fde9455cb3d8857ed88389||Bournemouth University Research Online"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Quel r\u00f4le pour les acteurs publics dans l\u2019incitation priv\u00e9e aux investissements\u00a0?"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Quel r\u00f4le pour les acteurs publics dans l'incitation priv\u00e9e aux investissements ?"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "quel role pour les acteurs publics dans l incitation privee aux investissements"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>Une entreprise doit investir pour fournir un service \u00e0 une autorit\u00e9 publique.

The estimates show that students in higher poverty schools and with greater learning aptitude realize larger benefits from smaller classes."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2010-03-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.546645E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "\u0421\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432"}, "abstract": {"$": "\u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0438 \u0443\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u044f \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2010-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.546645E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Return to Profitabiolity after a Financial Crisis"}, "abstract": {"$": "The financial crisis in October 2007 that sent the stock markets in a downward spiral all around the globe started more than six years ago. Many countries are still experiencing the ripple effects despite intervention by several governments, acting singly and collectively, to help stem the crisis and support recovery. Yet, many firms around the globe have not firmly returned to profitability. This study, therefore, addresses the question: When do firms return to profitability after a financial crisis? and examines the time taken by industrial firms in three of the hardest hit Asian countries to return to profitability after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Earlier studies at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmicro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level has mainly focused on the profitability of financial institutions and generally been limited to the pre-crisis period and/ or a few years of the postcrisis period. This paper takes a longer perspective of the post-crisis period and focuses. The results show that, in each country, there are significant differences in the profitability of industrial firms in the shortterm before and after the crisis as well as in the longer-term post-crisis period. Further, the speed of recovery and the extent of the return to profitability vary from country to country."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2015-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.624046E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "2014 <scp>AARES</scp> Distinguished Life Member"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "2014 aares distinguished life member"}], "abstract": {"$": "Jim Ryan\u2019s outstanding professional career in agricultural economics has included important contributions to research and to policy formulation, both in Australia and internationally.

Russia has the mandatory Rules that govern the analysis of business entities in receivership. The Rules emphasize the significant role of analyzing financial statements. The relevant methods are not free from weaknesses. They almost ignore analytical capabilities of tax reporting, thus determining the main subject of the research. Objectives The objective of the research is to substantiate recommendations on improvement of methodological approaches to analyzing insolvent businesses on the basis of their financial statements and tax returns. Methods The article reviews the specificity of analyzing the debtor in compliance with the effective Rules and relevant clauses of the Draft Federal Standard on Analysis of the debtor's financial position and results of its financial, operating and investments activities as part of bankruptcy procedures. The methodology of the research relies upon the theory of corporate financial analysis. The recommendations are substantiated with regard to scope of financial statements and tax returns. Results The research identifies the main issues and limitations relating to the application of the existing methodological recommendations. It also finds key areas for revising and supplementing them. In particular, we suggest setting up a system of financial coefficients that would arrange for applying forecast models of corporate financial standing. We present what results can be achieved through analysis of tax returns. Conclusions and Relevance Analysis of financial reporting is reasonable to perform concurrently with analysis of tax returns since it is important to evaluate the debtor's financial position. However, purposes, methods and procedures of the analysis should strictly correlate with information scope of those sources. Methodological requirements should not be too stringent. It is difficult to reach such balance.

Infringements of antitrust laws involving the use of algorithms have occurred in the past. However, current concerns are of a different nature as they relate to the role algorithms can play as facilitators of collusive behavior in repeated games, and the role increasingly sophisticated algorithms can play as autonomous implementers of pricing strategies, learning to collude without any explicit instructions provided by human agents. In particular, it is recognized that the use of \u2018learning algorithms\u2019 can facilitate tacit collusion and lead to an increased blurring of borders between tacit and explicit collusion. Several authors who have addressed the possibilities for achieving tacit collusion equilibrium outcomes by algorithms interacting autonomously, have also considered some form of ex-ante assessment and regulation over the type of algorithms used by firms. By using well-known results in the theory of computation, I show that such option faces serious challenges to its effectiveness due to undecidability results. Ex-post assessment may be constrained as well.

Given the arrival of international tourists has increased and the mushrooming growth of the heritage hotels, a stiff competition has been escalating among the hoteliers.

Using the National Transfer Accounts\u2019 (NTA) First Demographic Dividend (FDD) model, growth effects are accounted by the impact of current public education expenditure on economic support ratio (ESR) and labour productivity through human capital investments. The results offer new macroeconomic evidence. Age structure transition reduces the education dependency ratio (EDR) by all levels of education but the highest in the elementary education. This impacts on a long-term decline in enrolment in elementary education where the current gross enrolment ratio (GER) is close to 100 per cent and a decline in current public education expenditure. Other things being equal, the resultant potential savings, or the availability of extra budgetary resources, is a new way of financing the investment requirements for secondary and higher education with the aim of increasing national economic growth through human capital investments. In particular, growth effects are shown to be positive, higher and longer up to 2050, if the current public education spending is reallocated more for the secondary and higher education. Surprisingly, growth effects are explained less by the ESR than labour productivity. This justifies a higher human capital investment to enhance labour productivity for attainment of higher economic growth. The afore- mentioned macroeconomic framework, results and implications are of general relevance for other developing countries in South Asia and elsewhere in the world. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: E65, H52, J11 </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2018-10-04"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.3377754E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.5681422E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.216", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The individuals' discretionary behaviors at work.

From a corporate branding perspective, the choice of a new name can be seen as a wish to stand out from a group of similar organizations. Conversely, from an institutional perspective, name change can be perceived as a way to claim membership of a given organizational field. The framework integrates these understandings and serves a double purpose. First, it can be applied as a theoretical lens through which we can analyze and consequently understand naming in diverse sectors around the world.

The main difference between these two models concerns the stochasticity of the free cash flows. While M&M assumes a strictly stationary process, M&E\u2019s process is a martingale. However, this subtle difference has not been fully exposed, and previous literature has produced partly erroneous statements or inconsistent valuation models. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to illustrate and accentuate the effect of these two mutually exclusive stochastic processes on the timely behavior of cash flows, discount rates, and values of the firm, equity, debt, and tax shield. For this purpose, we perform a numerical experiment that allows the determination of values and discount rates by means of the risk-neutral approach. We show that in the M&E model, all cash flows and values are path-dependent, while they are not in M&M\u2019s world. Furthermore, in M&E\u2019s model, all discount rates are time-invariant, except for the discount rate applied to tax shields, which depends on the lifetime of the cash flows. Contrarily, in the M&M setup, all discount rates change across time, except for the constant discount rate of the tax shield. This has consequences for the applicability of the well-known present-value formula for annuities and for building consistent valuation models for both finite and perpetual cash flows."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.1309773E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.65401E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "6", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.56", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Towards validating a framework of adaptive schemata for entrepreneurial success"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "towards validating a framework of adaptive schemata for entrepreneurial success"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:aggregator", "@trust": "0.89", "$": "Towards validating a framework of adaptive schemata for entrepreneurial success."}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>The role of entrepreneurship within the context of an emerging economy has been well documented.

In both legends, the military commander faces a much stronger opposing army, but instead of ordering his men to retreat, he orders them to act in a manner consistent with baiting the enemy into an ambush. The stronger opposing army, uncertain whether it is facing a weak opponent or an ambush, then decides to flee and avoid battle. Military scholars refer to both stories to illustrate the importance of deception in warfare, often highlighting the creativity of the generals\u2019 strategies. We model both situations as signaling games in which the opponent is uncertain whether the general is weak (i.e. has few soldiers) or strong (i.e. has a larger army waiting to ambush his opponent if they engage in combat). We then derive the unique Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium of the games. When the probability of a weak general is high enough, the equilibrium involves mixed strategies, with weak generals sometimes fleeing and sometimes bluffing about their strength. The equilibrium always involves the generals and their opponents acting as they did in the historical examples with at least a positive probability. When the probability of a weak general is lower (which is reasonable given the reputations of Li Guang and Zhuge Liang), then the unique equilibrium always involves bluffing by the general and retreat by his opponent. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2011-03-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.950806E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.6028186E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.36", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The Unreality Business - How Economics (and Management) Became Anti-philosophical"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the unreality business how economics and management became anti philosophical"}], "abstract": {"$": "This paper argues that economics, over the past 200 years, has become steadily more anti-philosophical and that there are three stages in the development of economic thought.

Because incomes from particular farming enterprises fluctuate widely depending on weather, crop prices, and macroeconomic policies, households adopt a number of strategies to smooth their consumption. One approach is to diversify the sources of income for the household. The members of peasant households may engage in farming, trading and other business activities, and wage labor (Reardon, Delgado, and Matlon). When household members are involved in multiple activities and pool their income, total household income may be less subject to extreme variation. Morduch notes \"mitigating risk through production choices can be costly since typically expected profits must be sacrificed for lower risk\" (p. 104). This approach to risk management may be costly for the household. Over the past three decades, economists have used theories of household risk management and consumption smoothing to explain behavior observed in peasant households. For example, the purchase and sale of assets are frequently used as a means of savings and consumption smoothing when there are limited formal financial institutions. Marriage decisions may establish kin relationships with people in areas that experience different weather and production shocks (Rosenzweig and Stark). Although it may seem inefficient for households to farm numerous small plots that are widely scattered, this strategy provides some protection against location-specific crop failures from bad weather or pests (McClosky, Walker and Ryan). The extensive literature on contracting and sharecropping arrangements focuses on the role that these institutions play in minimizing a household's exposure to risk (Hoff, Braverman, and Stiglitz).

In India, other than edible purposes, coconut is widely used in religious practices and, it is considered as symbol of prosperity. Despite these facts, several upturns and downturns occurring in the growth trends of coconut in recent periods irrespective of geographical differences. This study attempts to decipher the growth trends in the area, the production and yield of coconut in major coconut producing states in India from 2000\u20132001 to 2017\u20132018. Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are the states in India where coconut palms are extensively cultivated and produced in large quantities. These states together contribute to approximately 84 per cent of the total area for cultivation of coconut and account for over 87 per cent of total production in the country. We analyse the growth trends in coconut cultivation using appropriate growth equations to estimate the growth rates and instabilities in growth trends. Besides, we use decomposition analysis to find the role of area, price, yield and crop mix effects on coconut production. The results reveal that Karnataka secured high growth in coconut production and its productivity and recorded better acceleration but fluctuated heavily between the phases of years under investigation. It shows that the price effect and yield effect play a crucial role in the total change of coconut production among the selected states. Based on the results, we recommend the local governments and other dedicated authorities to ensure that coconut growers have better access to modern technology, quality inputs, marketing and credit facilities following local necessity. Eventually, these measures can attract and encourage many new farmers into coconut cultivation and thereby achieving better advances in coconut farming.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-05-12"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.3219467E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.0985328E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "6.776", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "9", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Corporate tax competition, tariffs and multinational firms"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "corporate tax competition tariffs and multinational firms"}], "abstract": {"$": "This note examines the effect of export taxes and tariffs on fiscal competition between countries seeking to attract taxable income from multinational firms.

It investigates the problems facing companies in their attempt to generate and recognise creativity, arguing that too often companies rely on traditional market research techniques that limit depth and richness of knowledge, prevent intuitive decision making and encourage safe incremental change and seller-centric behaviour. The authors suggest that much traditional customer research dampens creativity, because it is essentially backward-looking. It makes the assumption that customers have the ability and imagination to envision the future, to know what they will desire tomorrow and to be able to articulate that desire. The argument is that the answer to successful judgment is a high level of situational intelligence: the shared knowledge and cultural milieu that encourage managers to focus on and connect with stakeholders, which in turn facilitates more intuitive and creative decision making. The authors assert that the brand provides an essential construct of this concept. This paper sets out to illustrate, via theoretical analysis and practical examples, how the brand can contribute to situational intelligence and in doing so can increase the level of an organisation's ability to innovate and create value. Not only does the paper argue against traditional business practices that inhibit creative behaviour and the ability or willingness of managers to make creative judgments, it also advocates a process of creative brand free-flow. This is highlighted by research into a number of globally innovative companies that rely on their brand values to help them break down traditional corporate barriers and help guide, focus and facilitate creativity. This paper is valuable in that it illustrates how a shift in managerial and corporate thinking can lead to higher levels of significant innovation and value creation."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2006-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.6120922E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.7409463E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.45564857", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "managing organizational learning"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>The four papers in this special issue on organizational learning discuss and synthesize the diverse literature on the reframing managers' control orientations to organizational learning framework, organizational communication systems and processes as the foundations for generating and deploying knowledge, relationships between organizational learning styles and strategy formulation, and relationships of different learning to different types of corporate venture and venture effectiveness.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1997-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.2419583E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "8.0198287E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "12", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.005084656", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "IFRS Adoption and the Predictive Power of Earnings Components"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "ifrs adoption and the predictive power of earnings components"}], "abstract": {"$": "This study aims to analyze the predictive power of current accruals and cash flows for future earnings and how IFRS adoption have affected this power, for general firms and for firms with relative higher and lower levels of accruals.

Results show that work\u2010related, psychological, and emotional variable are the most relevant group of variables explaining IT career abandonment.

Moreover, the union tends to play a traditional conservative role, emphasizing protection of workers from management abuses, which stem from the imperfect nature of worker/community ownership arrangements and the imperfect nature of democratic management. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1983-08-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.5266896E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.2092345E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.542318E-7", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Service quality at Jordanian commercial banks: what do their customers say?"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "service quality at jordanian commercial banks what do their customers say"}], "abstract": {"$": "Based upon an extended SERVQUAL model, this paper attempts to measure the service quality in commercial banks in Jordan.

The results of the study found that the dimensions of service quality provided by Jordanian commercial banks are of great importance, respondents reported high levels of perceived service quality provided by Jordanian commercial banks, the assurance is clearly the most important dimension. Jordanian banks could realise a competitive advantage by emphasising assurance in service delivery. As a result, the Jordanian commercial banking sector needs to take initiative to become more competent by being more responsive through fulfilling their assurance for customers and by providing banking facilities more conveniently. It was therefore, recommended that banking service providers should pay special attention to their service quality and the factors that drive customer satisfaction.

In doing so, he generalizes several theorems arrived at previously by Morishima, Okishio, et al. concerning the static relationships between differences in the rate of exploi tation, the real wage and the rate of profit. However, Roemer's analysis suffers from his attempt to make inferences about the dynamics of exploitation, discrim ination and capitalist development based on an essentially static model.

We see evidence of this behavior both in the changed coefficients estimates from rolling regressions. We also find considerable commonality in deviations from UIP and PPP suggesting that these deviations are both driven by a common factor as the forecasting errors in exchange rates. Using a dynamic latent factor model we find that deviations from UIP are almost completely due to forecasting errors in exchange rates. Once the variation in the size of the forecasting errors is taken into account we find empirical support of a unitary value for the implied beta in the Fama regression.

The Polish experience is put in a wider context and provides an extensive discussion of possible institutional reforms that may be implemented to stabilise the path of fiscal policy and reduce the deficit bias. Although substantial improvements have been made in Poland with respect to fiscal transparency standards set by the IMF and EU there is still much scope for enhancement. The recommended change in fiscal policy would involve the implementation of medium-term budgetary framework that would ensure consistency between the budgetary process and medium-term fiscal goals. This should be accompanied by the introduction of binding constraints on fiscal policy. The expenditure rule could be reintroduced to strengthen fiscal discipline, as it could force policymakers to tighten fiscal policy. It seems to be indispensable to maintain fiscal rules at the local government level. The issue of still limited fiscal transparency and unsatisfactory performance of fiscal rules requires the undertaking of various appropriate measures to strengthen the policy framework in Poland. This can be done in our view by involving external institution entitled to examine fiscal transparency and the performance of fiscal rules in the budgetary process. We think that the institution that is fully capable to take the lead in this respect is the NIK, which was granted full independence in 1994 and has since proved to be successful in overseeing public finances.

After analyzing the contents of pertinent literature (126 articles, of which 89 are empirical) in both developed and developing country contexts, the study finds that corporate managers are still less concerned about the meaning and essence of pristine business goals and the true goals and role of CSR. They practice CSR largely in a voluntary philanthropic fashion to build public image and primarily enhance business profit, not necessarily for social wellbeing.

They were expected to maintain service to depositors and improve the condition of the thrift's books and records while more permanent solutions were explored. Without close monitoring by the FSLIC, problem institutions with low or negative net worth would have an incentive to take on risky strategies which could further erode net worth. Under the MCP, given the new incentive structure, agency theory predicts that there would be no incentive to exert effort in other than a risk-averse way. However, in an attempt to preserve asset values, the new managers may lock in negative or inadequate profit margins, thereby precluding the possibility of a return to solvency by a successful (lucky) gamble for large profits. Therefore, although the MCP may have reduced total costs to the FSLIC, as a result of the absence of a profit motive and the conservative strategies followed, the chances of the MCP institutions recovering to solvency may have been significantly lowered when compared to similarly insolvent institutions that were allowed to operate outside of direct government control."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1993-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.4049588E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.063308E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.019759795", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Understanding social entrepreneurship: A cultural perspective in business research"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "understanding social entrepreneurship a cultural perspective in business research"}], "abstract": {"$": "Abstract   This study investigates the cultural drivers of social entrepreneurship (SE), focusing on the way in which Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) affects social entrepreneurial activity (SEA) in different countries.

Second, we examine whether positive macroeconomic signals such as remittances mitigate the negative effect of oil rents on economic growth in a sample of 43 SSA countries spanning 1990\u20132017. We employ the pooled ordinary least squares, fixed-effects, random-effects and generalized method of moments. The resulting empirical evidence established are: (1) there is a positive impact of forest rent on economic growth whilst oil rent and natural gas rent have a negative impact on economic growth (2) there is a positive marginal and net effect on economic growth from the interaction between remittances and oil rent. In addition, the unconditional effect of remittances on growth is positive. We further perform a threshold analysis to establish a critical ground that could also influence economic growth positively. This threshold is crucial because below these critical mass remittance inflows mitigate the negative incidence of oil rent on economic growth and above the threshold, negative oil rent on growth is completely nullified.

This work complements other contemporary research on the quality of IFRS financial statements where the properties of earnings are used as an evaluation metric (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#b2\">Barth <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 2005</jats:ext-link>). Our evidence shows that disclosure quality has increased significantly under IFRS in the three European countries we analyse. This result holds not only for firms which have voluntarily adopted IFRS or U.S. GAAP, but also for firms which mandatorily adopted such standards in response to the requirements of specific stock market segments. Although we cannot establish direct causality due to the inherent self\u2010selection issues for most of our sample firms, the evidence shows that the quality of financial reports has increased significantly with the adoption of IFRS.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2006-09-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "1.8920408E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.0109186E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "261", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "25.441807", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "20", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Factors Affecting Students in Vietnam's Intention on Using Smartphones for Learning on the Mobile Learning Platforms"}, "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic breaking out in countries, online learning is the most effective measure that can be implemented.

This study aims to provide such business development support tools to the food sectors SMEs of the GCC. This paper presents the results of an on-going research, part of which is investigating the factors influencing business development decision making, among SMEs operating in the food industry of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). To that end, the paper conducts an extensive literature review on the topic, which  is followed by an industrial field study, and analysis of the data obtained. The field study involved 36 companies within the food industry of the GCC region.   The findings from this study show that the SMEs in the food industry in the GCC region will need to have an effective business model in order to successfully run or grow their businesses. The initial result of this research shows that the business model canvas is the most suitable for SMEs in the GCC food sector. Furthermore, from the field study, a total of eleven influential factors have been identified, and these factors influence the approach to the business development process and the eventual success of such business development activities.  Finally, from the eleven factors, three themes were established. These themes showed the relationship between the influential factors and the BMC; the themes were the value proposition design, customer segmentation and business planning.  In conclusion, it was identified that the major challenge the food SMEs face is that of establishing a product-market fit in the development of their products and services. Product market fit as a challenge in the GCC is associated with the rapid geopolitical and social changes being experienced in the region. Hence, leading to changes in the demand and delivery of food products. Product market fit challenge is also linked to the fundamental weakness of the BMC identified in the study. Therefore, further research is required to see how the BMC can be enhanced, to make it more effective to the specific needs and structure of the GCC market environment.

Objectives In this regard, the research aims to identify the most efficient indicators to predict the gold market trends. Methods The paper is studying the technical analysis indicators in the gold market with the view of identifying the most useful effective trends for forecasting. The informational-empirical background comprises the periodical press materials and the archives of the MetaTrader platform quotations. As the research result, we have found that the most productive indicators proved to be as follows: 17-month and 11-month moving average indicators, 35-week and 55-week moving average indicators, VIX volatility index, Fibonacci levels and divergences on the RSI (Relative Strength Indicators) with parameter 9. The article also considers the correlations of the gold and silver quotes with the US dollar index. The paper also develops recommendations on the usage of these correlations in determining the forthcoming gold trend. Results We found that in case of decision-taking by the investor on settlement of gold transactions and based on the signals of obtained indicators, the investor could have made profit amounting to 372% for the last 10 years, while the gold itself have increased by 210% over this period. Conclusions and Relevance We conclude that the obtained research indicators help correctly forecast a long-term trend, which is easily confirmed by the historical testing of the indicators in the graph of gold since 2004."}, {"$": "\u0412 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0441 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438

However, there appears to be a lack of evidence on the actual existence of such relationships between motivational climate and attitudes to change in management literature, especially under the specific conditions of health care organisations in Slovakia. Using a sample of 243 employees of the University Hospital Bratislava, the present study has investigated the validity of the assumption that: (i) low motivational climate will represent an inhibitor to change, and vice versa, (ii) the more attention is being paid by the organisation's management to implementation of change, resulting in the staff having positive attitudes to change, the higher the motivational climate within the organisation will be. The findings indicate that motivational climate of the hospital can be heavily influenced by the manner in which the change is being managed. Moreover, not only how change is being managed, but also how it is understood and accepted by the employees, as well as which outcomes the change results in, have significant effects on the perceived motivational climate. The results also show that to maintain the high motivational climate, thus stimulating desired behaviours in the staff, the hospital managers should keep, among other things, (i) encouraging the workers to make a creative contribution, (ii) informing them about the reasons why changes are being made, (iii) showing them how their work objectives relate to where the hospital is heading and that the cost of the current changes will not outweight the benefits, and (v) ensuring that adequate training is available to equip people for changes and giving them the support they need to cope with change. Last, but not least, the present study helps to demonstrate the importance of attitudes as a force that is powerful in determining work output.

We find that as the severity of the health effect is reduced, the WTA/WTP ratio converges across the sample and tends to a level that does not significantly exceed unity.
