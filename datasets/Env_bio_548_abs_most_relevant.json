The current study was conducted in the hyporheic zone (HZ) at the Hanford Site of the U.S. Department of Energy, which has been known for its highly heterogeneous sediments and transient hydrodynamics. Distributions of hydraulic conductivity and sediment-associated Fe concentration were averaged at a group of SRs, while measured hourly water levels were further moving averaged at daily and monthly TRs. Fe concentration is selected for assembling geochemical heterogeneity due to its important role in redox transformation of Cr at the site. Three Fe distributions, with Fe concentrated on small, medium, and large sediment grains, respectively, were also considered. A series of flow and reactive transport simulations configured with different combinations of SRs, TRs, and Fe distributions were conducted. Simulated results revealed that Cr(VI) discharged to river is underestimated if SR decreases. For both the hydrodynamics and the discharge of Cr(VI) to river, difference caused by SR can be amplified with the decrease of TR. Biogeochemical transformation of Cr is more dependent on SR while hydrodynamics is on TR. The stronger control of SR than TR on biogeochemical transformation of Cr is resulted from more sensitive increase of Fe(II) with decreasing SR than with decreasing TR. Effect of SR is highly sensitive to variations of SR with Fe on medium-size grains while is persistent to a much smaller SR with Fe on small-size grains. Results from the current study are expected to benefit modelers on the selections of the spatial-temporal resolutions for in-house modeling and field sampling, which may also have implications for upscaling."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-12-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9671152E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.4368786E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "3.176", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Inland Waterway Navigation Project Design"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "inland waterway navigation project design"}], "abstract": {"$": "The design process and studies needed to develop a modern inland waterway system are presented.

The elimination of closed depressions by filling implicitly assumes that all depressions are caused by elevation underestimation. This assumption is difficult to support, as depressions can be produced by overestimation as well as by underestimation of DEM values.This paper presents a new algorithm that is applied in conjunction with conventional depression filling to provide a more realistic treatment of those depressions that are likely due to overestimation errors. The algorithm lowers the elevation of selected cells on the edge of closed depressions to simulate breaching of the depression outlets. Application of this breaching algorithm prior to depression filling can substantially reduce the number and size of depressions that need to be filled, especially in low relief terrain.Removing or reducing the size of a depression by breaching implicitly assumes that the depression is due to a spurious flow blockage caused by elevation overestimation. Removing a depression by filling, on the other hand, implicitly assumes that the depression is a direct artifact of elevation underestimation. Although the breaching algorithm cannot distinguish between overestimation and underestimation errors in a DEM, a constraining parameter for breaching length can be used to restrict breaching to closed depressions caused by narrow blockages along well-defined drainage courses. These are considered the depressions most likely to have arisen from overestimation errors. Applying the constrained breaching algorithm prior to a conventional depression-filling algorithm allows both positive and negative elevation adjustments to be used to remove depressions.The breaching algorithm was incorporated into the DEM pre-processing operations of the TOPAZ software system. The effect of the algorithm is illustrated by the application of TOPAZ to a DEM of a low-relief landscape. The use of the breaching algorithm during DEM pre-processing substantially reduced the number of cells that needed to be subsequently raised in elevation to remove depressions. The number and kind of depression cells that were eliminated by the breaching algorithm suggested that the algorithm effectively targeted those topographic situations for which it was intended. A detailed inspection of a portion of the DEM that was processed using breaching algorithm in conjunction with depression-filling also suggested the effects of the algorithm were as intended.The breaching algorithm provides an empirically satisfactory and robust approach to treating closed depressions in a raster DEM. It recognises that depressions in certain topographic settings are as likely to be due to elevation overestimation as to elevation underestimation errors. The algorithm allows a more realistic treatment of depressions in these situations than conventional methods that rely solely on depression-filling."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1999-08-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "1.6446858E-8", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.0306964E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "140", "@class": "C3"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "8.8266115", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "6", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Two-stage surrogate model-assisted Bayesian framework for groundwater contaminant source identification"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "two stage surrogate model assisted bayesian framework for groundwater contaminant source identification"}], "abstract": {"$": "Abstract   Groundwater contaminant source identification is normally a prerequisite for contaminant remediation. This study proposes a new two-stage surrogate-assisted Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based Bayesian framework to identify contaminant source parameters for groundwater polluted by dense nonaqueous phase liquid. In the framework, an adaptive update feedback process is proposed to construct a locally accurate surrogate model over posterior distributions to replace the time-consuming multiphase flow model. To increase the efficiency of the MCMC simulation, a multiobjective feasibility-enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOFEPSO) is adopted to generate the initial guess of the contamination source parameters. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are confirmed via a synthetic study. The contaminant source parameters generated by the proposed approach are compared with those computed by the one-stage surrogate-assisted MCMC-based Bayesian approach. The results demonstrate that the root mean squared error (RMSE) between true value of parameters and maximum a-posteriori density values (MAP) obtained by the proposed method decreased by 71.3% compared with those obtained by one-stage surrogate-based framework. To further assess the efficiency of MOFEPSO, the same inversion problem is solved with random values as the initial guesses of the unknown parameters during MCMC simulation; the other conditions are the same as the proposed framework. The results indicate that adopting MOFEPSO improves the efficiency of MCMC simulation.

As the primary commercial crop, rice cultivation should be allocated the most irrigation water, followed by corn, potato and soybean. Potato yield should be increased to compensate for reduced productivity of the other crops since 2019. It is also revealed that economic benefits are proportional to water environmental pollution in the SHRW. Therefore, decision-makers should adopt the most reasonable suggested schemes after fully balancing the trade-off of environment and economy. Most importantly, a variety of supporting policies are required for enabling sufficient implementation of these measures across the SHRW. For instance, individual farmers can be encouraged to follow the overall crop cultivation plan by the alteration of subsidiaries, taxes, and prices on crop-related activities. The modeling solutions show that the IFWRFP approach can systematically optimize allocations of water resources and cultivation patterns and thus potentially eliminate the problems of water scarcity, water contamination, and soil erosion in the SHRW."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2018-08-08"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.7376227E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.3920475E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "15", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "6.535616", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "6", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Identification of sources and infiltration regimes of nitrate in the semi-arid Kalahari: Regional differences and implications for groundwater management"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "identification of sources and infiltration regimes of nitrate in the semi arid kalahari regional differences and implications for groundwater management"}], "abstract": {"$": "The Kalahari region of southern Africa offers much potential for nitrogen input into its groundwater.

Comparative data from 3 groundwater study sites in the Kalahari of Botswana and Namibia with widely different characteristics are presented.

This study aimed to improve understanding of the influence of bed elevation discordance on the flow patterns and head losses in a right-angled confluence of an open channel with rectangular cross-sections. A large eddy simulation (LES)-based numerical model was set up and validated with experiments by others. Four configurations with different bed discordance ratios were investigated. The results confirm that, with increasing bed elevation discordance, the tributary streamlines at the confluence interface deviate less from the geometrical confluence angle, the extent of the recirculation zone (RZ) gets smaller, the ratio of the water depth upstream to that downstream of the confluence decreases, and the water level depression reduces. The bed elevation discordance also leads to the development of a large-scale structure in the lee of the step. Despite the appearance of the large-scale structure, the reduced extent of the RZ and associated changes in flow deflection/contraction reduce total head losses experienced by the main channel with an increase of the bed discordance ratio. It turns out that bed elevation discordance converts the lateral momentum from the tributary to streamwise momentum in the main channel more efficiently.

This paper presents a numerical evaluation of the randomness which can be observed in the geometry of major river channels. The method used is based upon that of generating a Sierpinski triangle via the chaos game technique, played with the sequence representing the river topography. The property of the Sierpinski triangle is that it can be constructed only by playing a chaos game with random values. Periodic or chaotic sequences always produce an incomplete triangle. The quantitative data about the scale of the random behaviour of the river channel pathway was evaluated by determination of the completeness of the triangle, generated on the basis of sequences representing the river channel, and measured by its fractal dimension. The results show that the most random behaviour is observed for the Danube River when sampled every 715 m. By comparing the maximum dimension of the obtained Sierpinski triangle with the gradient of the river we can see a strong correlation between a higher gradient corresponding to lower random behaviour. Another connection can be seen when comparing the length of the segment where the river shows the most random flow with the total length of the river. The shorter the river, the denser the sampling rate of observations has to be in order to obtain a maximum degree of randomness. From the comparison of natural rivers with the computer-generated pathways the most similar results have been produced by a complex superposition of different sine waves. By adding a small amount of noise to this function, the fractal dimensions of the generated complex curves are the most similar to the natural ones, but the general shape of the natural curve is more similar to the generated complex one without the noise.                     </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2009-06-23"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.33528E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.6027776E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.22738376", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Influence of Soil Air Permeability Change on Soil Vapour Extraction Systems Design"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "influence of soil air permeability change on soil vapour extraction systems design"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Soil air permeability plays a decisive role in the effectiveness of soil vapour extraction (SVE) for the removal of volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) from soil. The objective of this work is to study the change of the soil air permeability during continuous venting and removal of contaminant from a polluted soil. SVE pilot experiments were conducted to investigate the interaction of soil air permeability with total liquids saturation. Oppositely to previous studies, air permeability was measured by fitting pressure data measured in a 3D laboratory venting pilot to an analytical airflow solution. The experimental correlation was compared with two different correlations published previously. A difference was observed between measured and calculated air relative air permeabilities especially for low water saturation degrees. The importance of the correct estimate of relative permeability was then illustrated by comparing vacuums and streamlines calculated using measured permeability and permeability values estimated with the two correlations tested here. Results show that an inappropriate assessment of relative permeability may engender significant errors in designing an SVE system. The second part of this work reports on the influence of air permeability change on the prediction capability of an SVE mathematical model. A significant difference between simulated breakthrough curves, estimated using firstly the relationship established experimentally and secondly the two other correlations, was observed. These results lead us to say that inadequate characterization of the air permeability change may generate significant errors in removal rate and closure time estimates.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2012-01-16"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.3747969E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.1110793E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "8", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.5449761", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Spatial Variability of Surface Soil Moisture in a Depression Area of Karst Region"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "spatial variability of surface soil moisture in a depression area of karst region"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An understanding of soil moisture variability is necessary to characterize the linkages between a region's hydrology, ecology, and physiography.

Soil moisture content was measured at 20\u2009m intervals by intensive sampling on March 11 (dry season) and August 30 (rainy season) in 2005, respectively. Surface soil moisture presented a moderate variability in the depression area at the sampling times. The variability was relatively higher in dry season with lower mean soil moisture, but lower in rainy season with higher mean soil moisture after heavy rain event. Similar results were also obtained from the mosaic patterns of soil moisture generated by ordinary Kriging interpolation with low standard deviations. This suggested that more soil samples might be required and the sampling interval should be shortened in dry season compared with rainy season. The dominant influencing factors on the variability of surface soil moisture were rainfall and land use types.

Stream temperature is an important indicator for biodiversity and sustainability in aquatic ecosystems. The stream temperature model currently in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) only considers the impact of air temperature on stream temperature, while the hydroclimatological stream temperature model developed within SWAT model considers hydrology and the impact of air temperature in simulating the water-air heat transfer process. In this study we propose using the equilibrium temperature approach to model complex heat transfer processes at the water-air interface, which reflects the influences of air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and stream water depth on the heat transfer process. The thermal capacity of the streamflow is modelled by the variation of the stream water depth. An advantage of this equilibrium temperature model is the simple parameterization, with only two added parameters to model the heat transfer processes. The equilibrium temperature model is applied and tested in the Athabasca River Basin (ARB) in Alberta, Canada. The model is calibrated and validated at five stations throughout different parts of the ARB for which high-frequency observed stream temperature data are available. The results indicate that the equilibrium temperature model provided better and more consistent performances for the different regions of the ARB with the values of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (&gt;\u20090.67) greater than those of the original SWAT model and the hydroclimatological model. Overall, the equilibrium temperature model uses existing SWAT meteorological data as input, can be calibrated using fewer parameters and less effort, and has an overall better performance for the simulation of daily stream temperatures. Thus, it can be used as an effective tool for predicting the change in stream temperature regimes under varying hydrological and meteorological conditions. In addition, the impact of the stream temperature simulations on chemical reaction rates and concentrations was tested. The results indicate that the improved performance of the stream temperature simulation could significantly affect chemical reaction rates and the simulated concentrations and the equilibrium temperature model could be a potential tool to model stream temperature for water quality simulations.                         </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2017-07-25"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.0079278E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.2292801E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "28", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "7.916032", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "18", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Monitoring Well Installation, Purging, and Sampling Techniques \u2010 Part 1: Conceptualizations"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "monitoring well installation purging and sampling techniques part 1 conceptualizations"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Commonly employed techniques for the installation, purging, and sampling of monitoring wells are examined.

Aquifer response times were found to be influenced by the variations of the vadose zone thickness.

Instead, it was the intensity of the vertical inflow events and the local recharge rate that were found to exert an impact on the spatiotemporal variation of the aquifer response times. It was assumed that large amounts of vertical inflow increase the soil's volumetric water content above the water table, leading to higher values of hydraulic conductivity of  unsaturated soils , thus contributing to shortening aquifer response times.

Monte Carlo (MC) methods have been widely used in uncertainty analysis and parameter identification for hydrological models. The main challenge with these approaches is, however, the prohibitive number of model runs required to get an adequate sample size which may take from days to months especially when the simulations are run in distributed mode. In the past, emulators have been used to minimize the computational burden of the MC simulation through direct estimation of the residual based response surfaces. Here, we apply emulators of MC simulation in parameter identification for a distributed conceptual hydrological model using two likelihood measures, i.e. the absolute bias of model predictions (Score) and another based on the time relaxed limits of acceptability concept (pLoA). Three machine learning models (MLMs) were built using model parameter sets and response surfaces with limited number of model realizations (4000). The developed MLMs were applied to predict pLoA and Score for a large set of model parameters (95\u2009000). The behavioural parameter sets were identified using a time relaxed limits of acceptability approach based on the predicted pLoA values; and applied to estimate the quantile streamflow predictions weighted by their respective Score. The three MLMs were able to adequately mimic the response surfaces directly estimated from MC simulations; and the models identified using the coupled ML emulators and the limits of acceptability approach have performed very well in reproducing the median streamflow prediction both during the calibration and validation periods.                         </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-10-07"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.2591565E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.2974053E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "15", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "5.4064", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "11", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Inter-relationship between mean-daily irradiation and temperature, and decomposition models for hourly irradiation and temperature"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "inter relationship between mean daily irradiation and temperature and decomposition models for hourly irradiation and temperature"}], "abstract": {"$": "Terrestrial temperature records have existed for centuries.

We test this hypothesis by modelling Chinook salmon (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</jats:italic>) spawning habitat in a 6\u2010km long reach of Bear Valley Creek (Idaho, USA) with microhabitat resolution of 1\u2010m square. We use two\u2010dimensional hydraulic numerical modelling coupled with suitability curves to predict the spatial distribution of spawning habitat quality. We quantify connectivity for each habitat patch with the ratio between the area of neighbouring patches and their squared hydrographic distances. Results from a logistic regression analysis comparing predicted with observed spawning locations indicate that habitat quality and patch size are important factors and connectivity among patches may have a secondary effect. Therefore, spatial distribution of aquatic habitat and size of habitat patches are important aspects of its quality, suggesting that composite metrics such as weighted usable area may not be sufficient in defining the condition of the river environment.

Commonly implemented numerical models are of the shock fitting type that tracks the location of a pipe filling bore. However, the flow regime transition does not have to occur through a pipe filling bore. Another possibility involves a free surface bore with a following gradual transition to a full pipe condition. Large air volumes may be trapped in this situation following the bore reflection off a tunnel transition if this reflection closes the flow cross-section. Experimental observations are presented to demonstrate both types of flow regime transition. Traditional shock fitting methods are ill-equipped to accurately simulate gradual flow regime transitions.

The US Nature Conservancy developed a method known as the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration, IHA (Richter et al. 1996, 1997, 1998), for assessing the degree of hydrological alteration attributable to human induced changes within an ecosystem. The method is based on the statistical analyses of 33 hydrological parameters representing five streamflow characteristics that can be attributed to playing major roles in determining the nature of aquatic and riparian ecosystems (Richter et al. 1996, 1997, 1998). The Range of Variability Approach, RVA, is an application of the IHA, incorporating the concepts of hydrological variability and river ecosystem integrity, and was developed to enable river managers to define and adopt preliminary flow management targets before conclusive, long-term ecosystem research results are available. This paper presents an application of the RVA to simulated streamflows at two of the four Instream Flow Requirements (IFR) Sites on the Mkomazi River in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in order to assess the extent of alteration caused by human induced changes to the hydrological regime. The assessment was achieved by comparing the range of variation of the hydrological regime simulated under natural catchment conditions (pre-impact) with the variation resulting from catchment development (post-impact). The 25th and 75th percentile values of each of the 33 parameters were selected as the lower and upper thresholds within which streamflow management targets could be set. By setting preliminary streamflow management thresholds that can be modified and refined when ecological data and information become available, the RVA incorporates flexibility and adaptability.

We selected the frequent landslide-prone area in the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia as a case study to test this novel approach. These transformations were then assessed by three benchmark ML methods, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGB), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural networks (ANN).

Stressed groundwater systems may lead to a poor ecological status of surface waters but to date no conceptual framework to analyse linked multi-stressed groundwater - surface water systems has been developed.

This framework will be illustrated by applying it to four European catchments, the Odense, Denmark, the Regge and Dinkel, Netherlands, and the Thames, UK, and by assessing its utility in analysing the propagation or buffering of multi-stressors through groundwater to surface waters in these catchments. It is shown that groundwater affects surface water flow, nutrients and temperature, and can both propagate stressors towards surface waters and buffer the effect of stressors in space and time. The effect of groundwater on drivers and states depends on catchment characteristics, stressor combinations, scale and management practises.

The temporal and spatial dynamics of streamflow presence and absence is considered vital information to many hydrological and ecological studies.

Oxygen\u201018 (<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O) concentrations were measured at weekly intervals for 8\u201315 months at six sites, ranging from Pukemanga Stream baseflow through wetland seepage to ephemeral streams and surface runoff. The first two showed no significant <jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O variations. Inferred mean residence times within the catchment ranged from at least 4 years (for the stream baseflow and seepage) to a few weeks (for the ephemeral flows and surface runoff). Silica concentrations could also be used to distinguish deep flowpath water from near\u2010surface flowpath water. Tritium concentrations gave an estimated mean residence time of 9 years for Pukemanga Stream baseflow. Sulphur hexafluoride tended to give younger ages, while the chlorofluorocarbon ages were older, but are not considered as reliable for dating streamflow in this time range. These results show that deep pathways predominate with over 74% of runoff deriving from deep hillslope flowpaths via the wetland, and 87% of total drainage (baseflow and deep seepage) travelling via deep hillslope flowpaths. Our conception of the deep drainage process is that there is a large volume of slowly moving water in the system (above and below the water table), which reaches the wetland and stream via an unconfined groundwater system. Subsurface water equivalents are estimated to be 2\u00b79 m for drainage at the weir and 4\u00b71 m for drainage bypassing the weir, giving a total of 7 m depth over the catchment. The unsaturated zone plays an important role in storing water for long periods (about 4 years), while linking the surface with the groundwater water table to contribute to the fast streamflow response to rainfall.

In the event of a release, a thorough understanding of solute transport within the saturated zone is necessary to predict plume fate and the potential impacts on peatland ecosystems. To better characterize contaminant transport in these systems, approximately 13,000\u00a0L/day of sodium chloride tracer (200\u00a0mg/L) was released into a bog in the James Bay Lowland. The tracer was pumped into a fully penetrating well (1.5\u00a0m) between July 5 and August 18, 2015. Horizontal and vertical plume development was measured via in situ specific conductance and water table depth from an adaptive monitoring network. Over the spill period, the bulk of the plume travelled a lateral distance of 100\u00a0m in the direction of the slight regional groundwater and topographical slope. The plume shape was irregular and followed the hollows, indicating preferential flow paths due to the site microtopography. Saturated transport of the tracer occurred primarily at ~25\u00a0cm below ground surface (bgs), and at a discontinuous high hydraulic conductivity layer ~125\u00a0cm bgs due to a complex and heterogeneous vertical hydraulic conductivity profile. Plume measurement was confounded by a large amount of precipitation (233\u00a0mm over the study period) that temporarily diluted the tracer in the highly conductive upper peat layer.

Ion concentrations were more closely dependent on instantaneous discharge at Montseny than at Prades. The residuals of the relationship between solute concentrations and discharge retained a strong seasonality at Prades, but not at Montseny. These differences are related to the major hydrochemical processes that determine the streamwater chemistry at each site. The same processes are probably operative in the three catchments, but are of varying relative importance. At Montseny, the mixing of waters of different chemical composition seems to be the major process controlling streamwater chemistry, although the soilwater end-member composition predicted by the mixing model applied did not match the measured soilwater chemistry. In the drier Prades catchments, the two major hydrochemical processes determining the seasonal variation of streamwater chemistry are (1) the restart of flow after the summer drought, which flushes out the solutes accumulated during the dry period, and (2) the seasonal changes in groundwater chemistry that result from the interplay of water residence time, temperature and CO 2  partial pressure.

This paper examines the success drivers and the major transformative shifts required to sustain efforts in Ghana's water sector. The findings indicate that the successes chalked in Ghana's water sector have been largely fuelled by strong donor support and a well organised institutional and policy framework. About 90% of funding for the sector has been contributed by donors and creditors while actual government expenditure remains below 0.5% of GDP. The country has a strong policy and institutional framework guiding developments in the water sector. Nevertheless, the dwindling donor support, poor cost recovery mechanisms in the sector, ineffective strategies for ensuring human right to water, unbridled pollution of freshwater resources, poor borehole construction, and poor environmental sanitation across the country threaten to unwind the progress made in the sector. Without a paradigm shift, these could potentially derail efforts at achieving and sustaining universal water coverage.

There is an increasing demand for assessment of water provisioning ecosystem services. While simple models with low data and expertise requirements are attractive, their use as decision-aid tools should be supported by uncertainty characterization. We assessed the performance of the InVEST annual water yield model, a popular tool for ecosystem service assessment based on the Budyko framework. Our study involved the comparison of ten subcatchments in the Cape Fear watershed, NC, ranging in size and land use configuration. We analyzed the model sensitivity to the eco-hydrological parameters and the effect of extrapolating a lumped theory to a fully distributed model. Comparison of the model predictions with observations and with a lumped water balance model confirmed that the model is able to represent differences in land uses. Our results also emphasize the effect of climate input errors, especially annual precipitation, and errors in the eco-hydrological parameter Z, which are both comparable to the model structure uncertainties. In practice, our case study supports the use of the model for predicting land use change effect on water provisioning, although its use for identifying areas of high water yield will be influenced by precipitation errors. While the results are inherently local, analysis of the model structure suggests that many insights from this study will hold globally. Further work toward characterization of uncertainties in such simple models will help identify the regions and decision contexts where the model predictions may be used with confidence.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2014-10-02"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.714312E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.591124E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "15", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.4297287", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "8", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "When Are Mobile Phones Useful for Water Quality Data Collection?

The study of single streamflow recession events is receiving increasing attention following the presentation of novel theoretical explanations for the emergence of power law forms of the recession relationship, and drivers of its variability. Individually characterizing streamflow recessions often involves describing the similarities and differences between model parameters fitted to each recession time series. Significant methodological sensitivity has been identified in the fitting and parameterization of models that describe populations of many recessions, but the dependence of estimated model parameters on methodological choices has not been evaluated for event-by-event forms of analysis. Here, we use daily streamflow data from 16 catchments in northern California and southern Oregon to investigate how combinations of commonly used streamflow recession definitions and fitting techniques impact parameter estimates of a widely used power law recession model. Results are relevant to watersheds that are relatively steep, forested, and rain-dominated. The highly seasonal mediterranean climate of northern California and southern Oregon ensures study catchments explore a wide range of recession behaviors and wetness states, ideal for a sensitivity analysis. In such catchments, we show the following: (i)\u00a0methodological decisions, including ones that have received little attention in the literature, can impact parameter value estimates and model goodness of fit; (ii)\u00a0the central tendencies of event-scale recession parameter probability distributions are largely robust to methodological choices, in the sense that differing methods rank catchments similarly according to the medians of these distributions; (iii)\u00a0recession parameter distributions are method-dependent, but roughly catchment-independent, such that changing the choices made about a particular method affects a given parameter in similar ways across most catchments; and (iv)\u00a0the observed correlative relationship between the power-law recession scale parameter and catchment antecedent wetness varies depending on recession definition and fitting choices. Considering study results, we recommend a combination of four key methodological decisions to maximize the quality of fitted recession curves, and to minimize bias in the related populations of fitted recession parameters.                     </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2017-01-04"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.6131707E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.6168508E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "53", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "16.766706", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "18", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Dimensionless S\u2010Graphs for Urban Watersheds"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "dimensionless s graphs for urban watersheds"}], "abstract": {"$": "The unit hydrograph is a widely used method for hydrologic design.

The hydraulic simulations, carried out with a demand-driven approach by means of the EPANET2 software, have shown that, unlike entropy, resilience may represent a useful index of network robustness with regard to link failures.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2012-03-02"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "7.579264E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.0248123E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "67", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "10.059853", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "13", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Book Reviews / Analyses bibliographiques"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "book reviews analyses bibliographiques"}], "abstract": {"$": "ROCKFILL IN HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ROCKFILL IN HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING by D.

Such an approach has been tested on the Fecht research basin (Vosges Massif, France) over a 5\u2010year period, using the semidistributed conceptual MC model, whose physical soundness has been improved. The catchment discretization into land units was based on simple physiographic criteria, which were statistically validated. Water balance parameters were derived from measured soil water retention, without any calibration. Catchment streamflow was used to calibrate water transfer parameters over a single year and validate the model. Two subcatchments were used for the internal validation, and two neighboring nested catchments were used for the regional transposition of both the model and its distributed parameterization. At the mesh scale (250 to 1000 m), snowpack and soil water storages and contribution to streamflow were validated by using measurements from two small catchments.

The goal of the study is to reduce uncertaintiesin the hydraulic model and thus provide more reliable simulations and forecasts in real time for operationaluse by the national hydrometeorological flood forecasting center in France. Previous studies haveshown that sequential assimilation of water level or discharge data allows to adjust the inflows to thehydraulic network resulting in a significant improvement of the discharge while leaving the water levelstate imperfect. Two strategies are proposed here to improve the water level-discharge relation in themodel. At first, a modeling strategy consists in improving the description of the river bed geometry usingtopographic and bathymetric measurements. Secondly, an inverse modeling strategy proposes to locallycorrect friction coefficients in the river bed and the flood plain through the assimilation of in situ waterlevel measurements. This approach is based on an Extended Kalman filter algorithm that sequentiallyassimilates data to infer the upstream and lateral inflows at first and then the friction coefficients. Itprovides a time varying correction of the hydrological boundary conditions and hydraulic parameters.The merits of both strategies are demonstrated on the Marne catchment in France for eight validationflood events and the January 2004 flood event is used as an illustrative example throughout the paper.The Nash\u2013Sutcliffe criterion for water level is improved from 0.135 to 0.832 for a 12-h forecast lead timewith the data assimilation strategy. These developments have been implemented at the SAMA SPC (localflood forecasting service in the Haute-Marne French department) and used for operational forecast since2013. They were shown to provide an efficient tool for evaluating flood risk and to improve the flood earlywarning system. Complementary with the deterministic forecast of the hydraulic state, the estimation ofan uncertainty range is given relying on off-line and on-line diagnosis.

The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values obtained for the streamflow simulations were 0.75 and 0.78 for the calibration and evaluation periods, respectively.

The predicted monthly TN load was correlated with irrigation (r = 0.61) and the monthly TP load with precipitation (r = 0.89), indicating that nitrogen transport is primarily associated with soil leaching and groundwater flow, and phosphorus is primarily transported by sediments caused by rainfall erosion. A case study of split nitrogen fertilizer applications demonstrated reduced annual TN load by as much as 13% in one year.

Catastrophe in Uttarakhand (June 2013) necessitates the research aspect of spillway rehabilitation. Increasing specific flow form hydraulic structures is one of the thought of spillway rehabilitation. Labyrinth weir may be used for amplifying specific flows of existing spillway. Sediment trapping behind Labyrinth weir might be one of the disadvantages for river with high sediment flow. The Piano Key Weir (PKW), ramped type Labyrinth weir is a hydraulically attractive alternative to linear overflow weirs, increasing the unit discharge for similar heads and spillway widths. This advantage allows operating dam reservoirs on an increased level and provides thereby an enhanced retention volume. It is a result of the non-linear nature of PKW being folded back and forth to make repeated cycles or keys. This type of weir is particularly suitable for sites where topographic conditions limit the extent of its width. Together with its high discharge capacity for low heads, this geometry makes these weirs interesting in spillway rehabilitation.

High-resolution monitoring of catchment hydrology and the concentrations of SS and volatile organic matter (VOM) were carried out in the first-order channel of the Den Brook headwater catchment in Devon (UK) during the 2006-2007 hydrological season. The widely used 'rating curve' (discharge-concentration) approach was employed to estimate yields of SS, but as demonstrated by previous researchers, this study showed that discharge is a poor predictor of SS concentrations and therefore any yields estimated from this technique are likely to be highly uncertain. Nevertheless, for the purpose of providing estimates of yields that are comparable to previous studies on other land uses/sources, this technique was adopted albeit in an uncertainty-based framework. The findings suggest that contrary to the common perception, grasslands can be erosive landscapes with SS yields from this catchment estimated to be between 0.54 and 1.21 t ha(-1) y(-1). In terms of on-site erosion problems, this rate of erosion does not significantly exceed the commonly used 'tolerable' threshold in the UK ( approximately 1 t ha(-1) y(-1)). In terms of off-site erosion problems, it is argued here that the conventional expression of SS yield as a bulk annual figure has little relevance to the water quality and ecological status of surface waters and therefore an alternative technique (the concentration-frequency curve) is developed within this paper for the specific purpose of assessing the ecological threat posed by the delivery of SS into surface waters. This technique illustrates that concentrations of SS recorded at the catchment outlet frequently exceed the water quality guidelines, such as those of the EU Freshwater Fisheries Directive (78/659/EC), and pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms. It is suggested that failure to recognise improved temperate grasslands as a potential source of particulate material could result in the non-compliance of surface waters to water quality guidelines, deterioration of ecological status and failure of water quality remediation measures."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2010-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.554038E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.093041E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "63", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "3.1307137", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "19", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A Study of the Uniqueness of the Soil Moisture Characteristic During Desorption by Vertical Drainage"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a study of the uniqueness of the soil moisture characteristic during desorption by vertical drainage1"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous experiments concerning the desorption of a horizontal column of uniform soil suggested that the moisture characteristic was not unique throughout the column.

However, identification of the complexity of streamflows is very challenging, due to the various mechanisms governing the streamflow process both in space and in time. The present study examines the complexity of daily streamflows in the west-flowing rivers of India. The false nearest neighbor (FNN) algorithm, a nonlinear dynamic-based method, is employed to determine the dimensionality of streamflow time series and, hence, to examine the complexity. The FNN method uses reconstruction of the single-variable streamflow time series in a multi-dimensional phase space, and identifies the FNNs in the reconstructed phase space. Daily streamflow time series from 13 gaging stations in the Tapi to Tadri basin are analyzed. The effect of delay time on the FNN dimension estimation of the 13 streamflow series is also investigated, by considering four different delay time values to represent different kinds of separation of elements in the phase space reconstruction vector (daily, annual, autocorrelation, mutual information). Collectively considering the different delay time values, the FNN dimensions for the 13 streamflow series are found to have a wide range of variability (with dimensions ranging from 5 to 20), indicating a wide range of complexity in the dynamics of streamflow in the Tapi to Tadri basin. The results generally reveal that: (1) for any given station, the FNN dimensions change with changes in delay time; and (2) for any given delay time, the FNN dimensions change for the different stations.

This study proposes a new model to estimate the bed shear stress in both vegetated and bare channels with smooth beds. The model, which is supported by measurements, indicates that for both bare and vegetated channels with smooth beds, within a viscous sublayer at the bed, the viscous stress decreases linearly with increasing distance from the bed, resulting in a parabolic velocity profile at the bed. For bare channels, the model describes the velocity profile in the overlap region of the Law of the Wall.

The terrestrial biosphere is an important global carbon (C) sink, with the potential to drive large positive climate feedbacks. Thus a better understanding of interactions between land use change, climate change and the terrestrial biosphere is crucial in planning future land management options. Climate change has the potential to alter terrestrial C storage since changes in temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations could affect net primary production (NPP), C inputs to soil, and soil C decomposition rates. Climate change could also act as a driver for land use change, thus further altering terrestrial C fluxes. The net balance of these different effects varies considerably between regions and hence the case studies presented in this paper The paper examines   African case study  at one example of how adaptation and mitigation can be usefully combined in a way that enhances incomes and diversifies livelihoods of the poor, while also securing benefits for biodiversity, gender equality and carbon sequestration. The case study describes how a pilot farm in Nigeria sub-Sahara  Africa, has evolved over time to address significant variations in climate change. The Northern Nigerian programme has had to adapt to successive droughts, a drying climate and a growing population increasingly gravitating to urban centers. Planting dense perennial hedges that act as windbreakers helps to generate an agriculturally conducive microclimate. Traditional predominantly rain-fed forms of agriculture have been replaced by irrigation-based commercial crops. The windbreakers fight wind-related soil erosion and desiccation of crops, which had not previously been addressed. They also provide valuable fuelwood for cooking, lessening the burden on girls and women to collect wood. The use of windbreaks to \"produce the environment\" has led to increased production of fruit and vegetables for commercial sale in domestic and high-value export markets as well as demonstrated carbon sequestration benefits. It also provides employment for young people and has helped train a new generation of farmers. The innovations and adaptation practices used in Nigeria have been taken up nationally and supported internationally as being relevant to other sub-Saharan countries, as they illustrate an innovative, integrated way of managing the environment to provide adaptation and mitigation benefits locally as well as globally The paper concluded that  agronomists should work alongside other scientists to develop adaptation options that are not only effective in terms of crop production, but are also environmentally and economically robust, at landscape and regional scales. Furthermore, such integrated approaches to adaptation research are much more likely to address the information need of policy makers.

The concentrated flows were turbulent in response to the flow discharge. The concentrated flows in the gully zones with native grass and bare land were sub- and supercritical, respectively. The flow rate and shear stress in Gully 3 upstream catchment area were highest among the four upstream catchment areas, while the flow rate and shear stress in the gully bed of Gully 4 were lowest among the four gully beds, indicating that native grass notably decreased the bank gully flow rate and shear stress. The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (resistance f) and flow energy consumption in the gully bed of Gully 4 were notably higher than those in the other three gully beds, clearly indicating that native grass increased the bank gully surface resistance and flow energy consumption. The Reynolds number (Re), flow rate, shear stress, resistance f, and flow energy consumption in the gully beds and upstream areas increased over time, while the sediment concentration in runoff and Froude number (Fr) decreased.

We analyzed long-term records (\u223c20\u00a0years) of nitrate-nitrogen concentrations measured in stream at three stations on the upper Vah River (Slovakia). Applying spectral analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis, we found a varying degree of persistence between the three analyzed sites.

In this paper, the Zhejiang area of Taihu Basin was selected to be the research target as the typical plain river network area. Thirty-five control units were divided with regional water environment and control section. Taking the data in the year 2011 as example, the proposed cumulative risk assessment method was used to identify the control units in different grades and the results demonstrated that the numbers of high-, medium-, low- and extremely low-risk control units are 13, 12, 5 and 5, respectively.

Results showed a high spatial and temporal variability, mainly associated with basin characteristics and local inputs. Higher values of total C were measured in the highly forested basins located in the northern part of the Attert River basin, whereas the highest values of total P were mainly associated with material coming from grassland and with the inflow of wastewater treatment plants (i.e. higher values of total P were measured in the southern part of the basin). The abundance of metals, not only in suspended but also in channel bed sediments, was generally as follows: Zn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cu. Both nutrient and metal concentrations were at a maximum at the beginning of the wet season, after having been accumulated during the summer. These values tended to decrease during autumn and winter due to sediment mobilisation, and a higher flow capacity to transport coarser particle fractions from the sources.

(doi:                   10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.08.016                                   , 2010). Fifty-five water samples were selected from different point in Oran sebkha basin for sampling purpose in July 2011. Physico-chemical parameters such as pH and electric conductivity were measured in situ. Moreover, chloride, sulfate, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium were measured in the laboratory. Inverse geochemical models of the statistical groups were developed using PHREEQC to elucidate the chemical reactions controlling water chemistry. The inverse geochemical modeling demonstrated that relatively few phases are required to derive water chemistry in the area. In a broad sense, the reactions responsible for the hydrochemical evolution in the area fall into three categories: (1) dissolution of evaporite minerals; (2) precipitation of carbonate minerals; and (3) weathering reactions of silicate minerals by Belkhiri et al. (doi:                   10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.08.016                                   , 2010). The high values of the physico-chemical parameters of water obtained in the present study sites indicate a variation in the physico-chemical parameters demonstrated that relatively few phases are required to derive water chemistry in the area. Range of values was found as pH (5.1\u20137.6), conductivity (720\u201315,820\u00a0\u03bcS\u00a0cm\u22121), chloride (994\u20137,810\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121), sulfate (6.1\u2013112.4\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121), alkalinity (421\u201319,962\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121), calcium (80\u2013680\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121), magnesium (212.4\u20134,525\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121), sodium (124.2\u20134,687.4\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121) and potassium (0.9\u201342.5\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121)."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2014-03-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.1421386E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.4539213E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "7", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.9387433", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Technical Performance Evaluation of Water Distribution Networks based on EPANET"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "technical performance evaluation of water distribution networks based on epanet"}], "abstract": {"$": "AbstractThis paper explores the use of Technical Performance Indexes (TPIs) to assess the operational performance of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) and exemplifies its suitability to easily identify problematic zones.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, over $300 million per year on average is spent on sinkhole related damage in the United States [1]. When a sinkhole is detected early, the department of transportation can track the growth rate to make decisions when to disrupt travel flow for repair, and to budget the repair from a maintenance perspective rather than a hazardous emergency. Current practices used for detection include Standard Penetration Test, Ground Penetration Radar, and multi-channel seismic survey can typically cost from $1,000 -$10,000. This study focuses on a potential real-time remote sensing sinkhole monitoring system that is different from the standard practice used today by the Department of Transportation. The primary function of the early detection device is designed on the principle of a hollow-core auger with a free-falling mass displacement trigger. At the top, an electronic enclosure is placed and is used to power the device from a normally \u201coff\u201d state to an \u201con\u201d state when a void is detected below the device. This triggering function allows the system to conserve its energy and have an in-situ period of several years. In order to test the certainty of the response of the auger exposed to the environmental conditions, a test was conducted at a construction fill pit. To simulate a cover-collapse sinkhole, a cavity was dug out approximately three inches below the estimated bottom of the auger. After two months of being in the ground, the test resulted in no sinkhole forming from the tunnel dug beneath the auger.

Some of the main network model characteristics are the pore and throat conductances and capillary entry pressures. Both parameters strongly depend on the pore and throat geometries. Because the shapes of the real pore cross-sections are generally highly irregular, it is important to use idealized shapes that lead to accurate approximations of the above parameters. The most common approach has been to choose a circle/ (irregular) triangle / square (C-T-S) pore geometry with a shape factor that matches that of the real pore shape. For these shapes, simple correlations between the flow parameters and the shape factor are available. However, it is well known that the parameters for these very regular convex shapes are often inaccurate compared to the real pore shapes. Here, we propose to represent the shapes by the regular, but generally non-convex, n-cornered star shapes. A new n-corner star shape characterization technique has been developed, which takes shape factor and dimensionless hydraulic radius as input parameters. A novel numerical technique has been used to derive the real pore entry pressures, whereas analytical expressions are used for the star shape. A set of 70 individual pores has been extracted from high-resolution 2D images of a Bentheim rock sample. The real shapes have been approximated by C-T-S, as well as by n-corner star shapes. The comparison results between predicted and real shape parameters for the entire set of pores show that the accuracy of the entry radius prediction for both approaches is approximately the same and quite good. The single phase conductance estimation is much better for n-corner star approximation than for C-T-S. Finally, a capillary bundle model has been constructed from the 70 pores to test the predictive capabilities of the characterization approaches in terms of relative permeabilies and capillary pressures. It has been shown that the n-corner star provides a better approximation of the \"real shape\" capillary pressure curve than C-T-S. The real shape relative permeabilities are in a good agreement with curves predicted by both shape approximations."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2008-09-08"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.5748908E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.1291527E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "13", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "3.1297653", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Extensive-Form Game for Examining Mutual Trust between a Reservoir Operator and Agricultural Water Users"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "extensive form game for examining mutual trust between a reservoir operator and agricultural water users"}], "abstract": {"$": "AbstractThis paper aims to illustrate the hidden bargain decision-making process undertaken by a reservoir operator and basin farmers along with water allocation of the Al-Tharthar reservoir locate..."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2018-02-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.0020215E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.4235463E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.216", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Catchment-scale hydrology simulations using inter-variable multi-parameter terrain descriptions"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "catchment scale hydrology simulations using inter variable multi parameter terrain descriptions"}], "abstract": {"$": "<p>Global simulations of hydrology and hydraulics combine network-type routing with hydrological simulations on large Hydrological Response Units (HRUs). In order to efficiently simulate the hydrological response of HRUs, empirical equations are generally applied to averaged physical parameters or empirical constants. The usage of physically-based equations on a spatial description of the HRU could provide benefits in accuracy and scenario assessment. In this research we develop a multi-parameter inter-variable terrain description to simulate HRU hydrology and flow. Water is distributed over these classifications and used for application of physically-based equations. A mass-balanced scheme is presented that uses parameter inter-variability matrices to update the distributions of water. Furthermore, the method is used to simulate processes using physically-based equations that result in fluxes from and to other classes within a distribution, resulting in a semi-spatial process description within an HRU. Finally, physically-based equations are thus applied to a dynamic semi-spatial HRU description using multiple inter-variable physical parameters. A variety of study cases on hypothetical and real events are performed to highlight the behavior and sensitivity of the model, as well as comparison to existing methods. Un-calibrated comparison with full spatial flow simulations show reasonable agreement with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.47. Comparison to simulations of real events on catchments in Northern China and Central Spain show good comparability with an average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.56. The performance of the model indicates good applicability when considering the efficiency of the method. Simulation time is in the ranges from fractions of seconds on consumer hardware without dependency of the area of the catchment. Additionally, the model uses physical parameters as input and physically-based descriptions of processes. This results in interactions between infiltration and flow that alter flow dynamics and hydrograph shapes in similar manners to full spatial hydrology and flow models. Finally, the method provides the possibility of linked additional processes such as groundwater and erosion, and could be applied on a global scale.</p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-10-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9474079E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.806403E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.36", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Application of Electrical Resistivity Imaging for MeasuringWater Content Distribution on Hillslopes"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "application of electrical resistivity imaging for measuring water content distribution on hillslopes"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:aggregator", "@trust": "0.89", "$": "Application of Electrical Resistivity Imaging for Measuring Water Content Distribution on Hillslopes"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) as a method for effectively evaluating soil water content distribution on natural hillslopes was validated by combining ERI technique with the invasive measurement of volumetric water content (\u03b8) using a combined penetrometermoisture probe (CPMP) on a hillslope in a head-water catchment underlain by weathered granite porphyry.

Several linearization approaches are discussed for the solution of the nonlinear system which results from a finite element discretization of the coupled equations. It is first shown that the most commonly used solution method can be viewed as a Picard linearization applied to the transport equation, with the coupling resolved by iteration over the two governing equations. The full Newton scheme for solving the coupled problem produces a Jacobian of size 2N \u00d7 2N, where N is the number of nodes in the discretization of both the flow and transport equations. To reduce the size and complexity of the full Newton scheme, a partial Newton method is proposed, which, like the Picard approach, produces matrix systems of size N \u00d7 N.

Results from two- and three-dimensional test simulations show that the partial Newton scheme gives improved convergence and robustness compared to Picard linearization, especially for highly advective problems or large density ratios.

An adequate spatial distribution of hydrological gauging stations presents a lot of interest in linkage with the river regime characterization, water infrastructures design, water resources management and ecological survey. Due to the increase of riverside population and the associated flood risk, hydrological networks constantly need to be developed. This paper suggests taking advantage of kriging approaches to improve the design of a hydrometric network. The context deals with the application of an optimization approach using ordinary kriging and simulated annealing (SA) in order to identify the best locations to install new hydrometric gauges. The task at hand is to extend an existing hydrometric network in order to estimate, at ungauged sites, the average specific annual discharge which is a key basin descriptor. This methodology is developed for the hydrometric network of the transboundary Medjerda River in the North of Tunisia. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is adopted to delineate basin limits and centroids. The latter are adopted to assign the location of basins in kriging development. Scenarios where the size of an existing 12 stations network is alternatively increased by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 new station(s) are investigated using geo-regression and minimization of the variance of kriging errors. The analysis of the optimized locations from a scenario to another shows a perfect conformity with respect to the location of the new sites. The new locations insure a better spatial coverage of the study area as seen with the increase of both the average and the maximum of inter-station distances after optimization.

Optimum bucking is cross-cutting of a tree into the sections that maximize the total economic value. Previous studies indicated that optimum method potentially increases economic value of the forest product up to 10% or more. On the other hand, optimum bucking requires large number of bucking combinations that can be quickly generated by computer-assisted methods.

In Turkey, bucking is generally performed based on loggers\u2019 experiences without using any scientific approach.

It is shown that within a wide range of flow parameters both undisturbed and free outflow conditions may exist for the same gate opening.

It is worth noting that a subcritical approaching flow may also exhibit such a hysteretic behavior provided the Froude number is greater than approximately 0.8.

In a side room off the third fl oor paediatric intensive care unit, I counted 27 newborn babies lying on four black mattresses on the fl oor. They were being held hostage by the hospital against payment of bills for their care. Their mothers, who had no hope of raising these sums, were allowed into the \u201cbaby prison\u201d every 3 hours to feed them, before being banished again. Some babies had been detained for months. That was in 2005, but the image is etched on my memory as the clearest example, although admittedly extreme, of the harm done by charging patients for medical services that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. Medical charities such as Save the Children have lobbied vigorously for the removal of charges, which are seen as a deterrent to care, and governments of some developing countries have introduced free access as a way of boosting their nation\u2019s health. Earlier this year that assumption was challenged by a fascinating study in Ghana of over 2000 households with children under 5 years old (PLoS Med 2009; 6: e1000007). Half were given free care and the remainder were made to pay, the normal practice in the region. The results showed, unexpectedly, that providing free care did not improve health, although it led to a slight increase in use of medical services. Anaemia, haemoglobin concentrations, parasite prevalence, and deaths were similar in both groups. What is the explanation? The authors suggest the increase in use of medical services by those with free care may have been too modest to make a diff erence. Alternatively, the other costs of treatment in Ghana such as travel, and taking time off work, were more important than the small charge\u201412 000 cedis (about US$1) for malaria treatment, for example. The issue of user fees is a fraught one. There is a strong equity argument for removing them and there may be other unmeasured eff ects. Clearly, there can be no justifi cation for the ludicrous fees imposed on mothers in the intensive care unit at Korle Bu Hospital. But this fi nding is a reminder that we must not let our hearts rule our heads. In terms of maximising bang for bucks, abolishing user fees may not be the best way of increasing health gain.

However, conduits also exist in eogenetic karst aquifers, despite high matrix permeability which accounts for a significant component of flow. This study investigates dissolution within a 6-km long conduit system in the eogenetic Upper Floridan aquifer of north-central Florida that begins with a continuous source of allogenic recharge at the Santa Fe River Sink and discharges from a first-magnitude spring at the Santa Fe River Rise. Three sources of water to the conduit include the allogenic recharge, diffuse recharge through epikarst, and mineralized water upwelling from depth. Results of sampling and inverse modeling using PHREEQC suggest that dissolution within the conduit is episodic, occurring only during 30% of 16 sampling times between March 2003 and April 2007. During low flow conditions, carbonate saturated water flows from the matrix to the conduit, restricting contact between undersaturated allogenic water with the conduit wall. When gradients reverse during high flow conditions, undersaturated allogenic recharge enters the matrix. During these limited periods, estimates of dissolution within the conduit suggest wall retreat averages about 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 m/day, in agreement with upper estimates of maximum wall retreat for telogenetic karst. Because dissolution is episodic, time-averaged dissolution rates in the sink-rise system results in a wall retreat rate of about 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 m/day, which is at the lower end of wall retreat for telogenetic karst. Because of the high permeability matrix, conduits in eogenetic karst thus enlarge not just at the walls of fractures or pre-existing conduits such as those in telogenetic karst, but also may produce a friable halo surrounding the conduits that may be removed by additional mechanical processes. These observations stress the importance of matrix permeability in eogenetic karst and suggest new concepts may be necessary to describe how conduits develop within these porous rocks."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2010-11-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.6507163E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.1450628E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "55", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "14.14901", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "11", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from swine wastewater by intermittent aeration processes"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from swine wastewater by intermittent aeration processes."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from swine wastewater by intermittent aeration processes"}], "abstract": {"$": "Nitrogen and phosphorus removal in a methane fermentation plus activated sludge method type pig farm (M-III) with an intermittent aeration process (IAP) was evaluated in comparison with a continuous aeration process (CAP) based on the full-scale and bench-scale experiments.

Rain-packed silt is dilatant and cannot deform without expansion which, in turn, requires water entry at a rate compatible with the required deformation. In the short duration of rain-impact events, hydrodynamic time lagging occurs because water can move only slowly through the small silt pores. Consequently, densely packed silt remains essentially rigid.

Sand, its larger pores invaded by hydraulic penetration jets which maintain loose packing, cannot behave in this manner.

Abstract. Many field observations have led to speculation on the role of piping in embankment failures, landslides, and gully erosion. However, there has not been a consensus on the subsurface flow and erosion processes involved, and inconsistent use of terms have exacerbated the problem. One such piping process that has been the focus in numerous field observations, but with very limited mechanistic experimental work, is flow through a discrete macropore or soil pipe. Questions exist as to the conditions under which preferential flow through soil pipes results in internal erosion, stabilizes hillslopes by acting as drains, destabilizes hillslopes via pore-pressure buildups, and results in gully formation or reformation of filled-in ephemeral gullies. The objectives of this article are to review discrepancies in terminology in order to represent the piping processes better, to highlight past experimental work on the specific processes of soil pipeflow and internal erosion, and to assess the state-of-the-art modeling of pipeflow and internal erosion. The studies reviewed include those that examined the process of slope stability as affected by the clogging of soil pipes, the process of gullies forming due to mass failures caused by flow into discontinuous soil pipes, and the process of gully initiation by tunnel collapse due to pipes enlarging by internal erosion. In some of these studies, the soil pipes were simulated with perforated tubes placed in the soil, while in others the soil pipes were formed from the soil itself. Analytical solutions of the excess shear stress equation have been applied to experimental data of internal erosion of soil pipes to calculate critical shear stress and erodibility properties of soils. The most common numerical models for pipeflow have been based on Richards\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 equation, with the soil pipe treated as a highly conductive porous medium instead of a void. Incorporating internal erosion into such models has proven complicated due to enlargement of the pipe with time, turbulent flow, and episodic clogging of soil pipes. These studies and modeling approaches are described, and gaps in our understanding of pipeflow and internal erosion processes and our ability to model these processes are identified, along with recommendations for future research."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2013-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.037257E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.7343039E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "51", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "8.206131", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "16", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Tracking <sup>14</sup>C-Labeled Organic Micropollutants to Differentiate between Adsorption and Degradation in GAC and Biofilm Processes"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "tracking 14c labeled organic micropollutants to differentiate between adsorption and degradation in gac and biofilm processes"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Tracking 14C-labeled organic micropollutants to differentiate between adsorption and degradation in GAC and biofilm processes"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:aggregator", "@trust": "0.89", "$": "Tracking 14 C\u2011Labeled Organic Micropollutants to Differentiate between Adsorption and Degradation in GAC and Biofilm Processes"}], "abstract": {"$": "Granular activated carbon (GAC) filters can be used to reduce emissions of organic micropollutants via municipal wastewater, but it is still uncertain to which extent biological degradation contributes to their removal in GAC filters. 14C-labeled organic micropollutants were therefore used to distinguish degradation from adsorption in a GAC-filter media with associated biofilm.

As described in this paper, MRVS processes were studied during full-scale field experiments wherein ambient or heated air was injected at high volumetric flow rates during in situ soil mixing, and VOCs were volatilized and advectively removed from the subsurface, captured in a shroud covering the mixed region, and then treated on-site. The field test was conducted at an inactive land disposal site in southern Ohio where dense silty clay soils were contaminated by VOCs at concentrations in the 10-500 mg kg -1  range. During the field studies, seven columns, each 3.0 m diameter and 4.6 or 6.7 m deep, were treated with ambient air (\u223c15-25\u00b0C) or heated air (\u223c120-130\u00b0C) injected at flow rates of 28-40 m 3  min -1 . Intensive monitoring and measurement activities defined contaminant behavior and key MRVS operation and performance parameters. The field testing revealed that MRVS could rapidly reduce the concentrations of VOCs (i.e., TCE, TCA,...) in dense silty clay soil by 88-98%. The rate and extent of reduction was somewhat higher with the injection of heated air as compared to ambient air.

The research was based on the materials of the long-term field observations which were carried out in the context of the studies of F.M. Milkov about anthropogenic landscapes. The use of expeditionary and stationary research techniques made it possible to receive the required material for the development of the optimization options of valley-river landscape-technical systems. Six options/practices for the optimization of valley-river LTchS on the example of the Right Bank zone of Ukraine are suggested. Option A does not envisage a control regain over landscape-technogenic systems (LTS); it can be used locally. Option B1 is directed towards a partial restoration of the previous func- tions of the system and an episodic/occasional control over a technical block of LTS. Option B2 implies a total change of the economic purpose of LTchS with the aim of recreation. Option B3 consists in making a nature reserve of some landscape technogenic systems,in perspective the range/habitat of unique species of flora and fauna can be saved or restored on these territories. The restoration of a landscape-techno-genic system to the \u00aboperation\u00bb stage with previous functions is achieved when option C1 is used. Option C2 requires substantial capital investments, as it implies the creation of an absolutely new landscape-engineering system. For this option, projects have been developed to restore sections in the valleys of the Sob River (Gaisyn city, Vinnytsia region) and the Hirskyi Tikych River (Buky town, Cherkasy region). A layout of the optimized valley-river LTchS on the territory of the Right Bank of Ukraine was suggest- ed. The conclusion has been made that the use of one of the suggested options will not help improve the condition of all valley-river landscape-technogenic systems of the model region. Each river valley requires an individual approach in which the combination of all the above-mentioned directions will be used. The valley-river landscapes optimized with help of the presented scheme will form the image of nature of a present-day European state which will favour the establishment of the concept of well-balanced development.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2022-09-24"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.4913103E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Modelling of flow in pipes and ultrasonic flowmeter bodies"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "modelling of flow in pipes and ultrasonic flowmeter bodies"}], "abstract": {"$": "The contribution gives a summary of the flow modelling in flow parts of ultrasonic flowmeters using CFD system ANSYS/FLUENT.

In the present paper, vegetation heterogeneity is incorporated through a two dimensional Poisson process representing the coexistence of two functionally different types of plants (e.g., trees and grasses). The space\u2010time statistical structure of relative soil moisture is characterized through its covariance function which depends on soil, vegetation, and rainfall patterns. The statistical properties of the soil moisture process averaged in space and time are also investigated. These properties are especially important for any modeling that aggregates soil moisture characteristics over a range of spatial and temporal scales. It is found that particularly at small scales, vegetation heterogeneity has a significant impact on the averaged process as compared with the uniform vegetation case. Also, averaging in space considerably smoothes the soil moisture process, but in contrast, averaging in time up to 1 week leads to little change in the variance of the averaged process.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2006-03-25"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "7.872556E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.13192336E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "65", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.553528", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "19", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Estimation of Sediment Yield and Maximum Outflow Using the IntErO Model in the Sarada River Basin of Nepal"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "estimation of sediment yield and maximum outflow using the intero model in the sarada river basin of nepal"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>Soil erosion is a severe environmental problem worldwide as it washes away the fertile topsoil and reduces agricultural production.

Two of the AS systems were Modified Ludzack - Ettinger (MLE) nitrification-denitrification (ND) systems and the third was a membrane University of Cape Town (UCT) ND and enhanced biological P removal system. One of the MLE systems and the UCT system were fed the same real settled wastewater. The other MLE system was fed raw wastewater which was made by adding a measured constant flux (gCOD/d) of macerated primary sludge (PS) to the real settled wastewater. This PS was also fed to a fourth AD and a blend of PS and WAS from settled wastewater MLE system was fed to a fifth AD. The five ADs were each operated at five different sludge ages (10-60d). From the measured performance results of the AS systems, the unbiodegradable particulate organic (UPO) COD fractions of the raw and settled wastewaters, the PS and the WAS from the three AS systems were calculated with AS models. These AS model based UPO fractions of the PS and WAS were compared with the UPO fractions calculated from the performance results of the ADs fed these sludges. For the PS, the UPO fraction calculated from the AS and AD models matched closely, i.e. 0.30 and 0.31. Provided the UPO of heterotrophic (OHO, fE_OHO) and phosphorus accumulating (PAO, fE_PAO) biomass were accepted to be those associated with the death regeneration model of organism \"decay\", the UPO of the WAS calculated from the AS and AD models also matched well - if the steady state AS model fE_OHO\u00a0=\u00a00.20 and fE_PAO\u00a0=\u00a00.25 values were used, then the UPO fraction of the WAS calculated from the AS models deviated significantly from those calculated with the AD models.

It is designed to meet needs defined through use cases co-designed with end users and enables the creation of custom geolocated points of interest. This approach enabled substantial progress over the previous iteration. Its reliance on geolocation data to anchor augmented objects relative to the user\u2019s position poses a set of challenges: On mobile devices, GNSS accuracy typically lies between 1 m and 30 m. Due to its impact on the anchoring, this lack of accuracy can have deleterious effects on usability. We conducted a comparative user test using the application in combination with two different geolocation data types (GNSS versus RTK). While the test\u2019s results are undergoing analysis, we hereby present a methodology for the assessment of our system\u2019s usability based on the use of eye-tracking devices, geolocated traces and events, and usability questionnaires.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2023-02-09"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.1880343E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.732766E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.6", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Numerical simulation of non-isothermal multiphase multicomponent processes in porous media."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "numerical simulation of non isothermal multiphase multicomponent processes in porous media 2 applications for the injection of steam and air"}], "abstract": {"$": "In part 1 [Class et al., this issue], we presented a numerical simulator for non-isothermal multiphase systems.

The first phase, if not the only phase of the purification process, consists in the removal of suspended solids.

Pollution by suspended solids may be characterized as follows : - a) by content, i.e. suspended solids concentration ; b) by turbidity. Units have been determined for each case, as well as measurement methods whereby process efficiency can be established. Solid particles are extracted by two different methods : - By gravity : flotation or sedimentation ; - By filtration or straining (distinction between macro, micro and ultra-filtration). These methods are unsuitable for direct elimination of colloids, for the following reasons : -Retention times are inconsistent with equipment operating conditions ; - Prohibitive cost. The elimination or colloids requires preliminary action to eliminate stability factors and allow collection of much coarser colloid particles for subsequent separation from the water by the above methods. Tests have been devised for establishing how to best deal with colloids. Two main types of test are electrophorelic measurement and flocculation tests. As pollution is often at least partly colloidal, most purification plants must include a flocculation-coagulation stage followed by one or more separation systems.

The numerical solutions were generalized using a dimensionless formulation. From a dimensionless tidal period and a dimensionless beach slope of 10%, we obtained results that apply to a wide range of beach permeabilities from 10 \ufffd 4 m/s to 10 \ufffd 3 m/s, beach slopes from 3.16% to 31.6%, tidal amplitude (0.3 m-2 m) and period (diurnal or semidiurnal). The numerical simulations demonstrated the following: The maximum Darcy velocity always occurs at the intersection of the watertable and the beach surface. The offshore beach groundwater is almost stagnant compared with the onshore groundwater flow, which may explain the previous observations that the major portion of the seaward groundwater seepage usually occurs in the shallow part of the submerged beach. The outflow from the seepage face accounts for 41\u201397% (average 55%) of the outflow from the intertidal zone. The amount of seawater infiltrating into the intertidal zone in a tidal cycle increases with the beach permeability and decreases when the inland recharge increases, and ranges from 35.5 m 3 yr \ufffd 1 m \ufffd 1 to 505.8 m 3 yr \ufffd 1 m \ufffd 1 for all the cases considered. Smaller beach slopes, smaller inland freshwater recharges, and/or greater beach permeability lead to larger saltwater plumes in the intertidal zone of the beach.

Under certain conditions analytical solutions to the governing flow equation can be derived. However, for most hillslopes aquifers, the transmissivity varies with topography and, for unconfined problems, through time. In addition, recharge rates are also functions of time and position. For these conditions analytical solutions for groundwater flow are difficult to derive. In this article a quasi-analytical solution procedure is presented which offers a number of advantages over existing analytical and numerical solutions to groundwater flow in unconfined, one-dimensional, hillslope aquifers. The method is based on dividing the problem domain into elements and assuming parameter values within the elements are constant. In Laplace transform space a simple analytical solution to a constant coefficient form of the governing groundwater flow equation can be derived. This analytical solution is used as an element \u201cbasis function\u201d; each element equation coupled together by conditions on mass and dependent variable continuity. Time stepping can be introduced to account for transient parameter variation.

Toluene was selected as a model compound for oxidizable contaminants. The two-dimensional microcosm was filled with quartz sand and operated under controlled flow conditions simulating a contaminant plume in otherwise uncontaminated groundwater. Aerobic degradation of toluene by Pseudomonas putida mt-2 reduced a continuous 8.7 mg L(-1) toluene concentration by 35% over a transport distance of 78 cm in 15.5 h. In comparison, under similar conditions Aromatoleum aromaticum strain EbN1 degraded 98% of the toluene infiltrated using nitrate (68.5+/-6.2 mg L(-1)) as electron acceptor. A major part of the biodegradation activity was located at the plume fringes and the slope of the electron-acceptor gradient was steeper during periods of active biodegradation. The distribution of toluene and the significant overlap of nitrate at the plume's fringe indicate that biokinetic and/or microscale transport processes may constitute additional limiting factors. Experimental data is corroborated with results from a reactive transport model using double Monod kinetics.

Two different parameterization schemes were implemented for hydraulic conductivity and specific storage. The first method solely relies on the relationship between hydraulic properties and burial depths. The second more complex strategy allows more spatial variations of hydraulic parameters using pilot points. The study provides new insights and practical guidance on the application of groundwater modelling for environmental impact assessment. The results suggest that the choice of model parameterization has a significant influence on predictive uncertainty. The model using the simple parameterization provides predictions with a much wider range than the model with a more sophisticated parameterization. This is because that the lowly parameterized model tends to generate more extreme effective hydraulic parameter fields unless the parameterization simplification converts the inverse problem to a (close to) well-posed problem that rarely exists for applied regional groundwater modelling.

To test this assumption, we related the intercepts of dQ/dt-Q curves from 72 recession events to the concurrent ET and watershed moisture storage as determined from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data set. The analysis suggests that at least for the nine watersheds from Illinois and New York we studied, shifts in recession rate during prolonged rain-free periods had little linkage to concurrent ET.

When recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) operate in freshwater farms during the dry seasons, the concentrations of these pollutants increase. The objective of the present study is the evaluation of a Continuous Flow Granular Reactor (CFGR) for the treatment of freshwater RAS stream at pilot-scale during two consecutive dry seasons. The CFGR was fed with a extremely low-strength recirculation stream of a trout farm (0.12\u20131.84 mg NH4+-N/L and 2.2\u20138.14 mg C/L). Two different configurations were evaluated. The first configuration consisted on a CFGR fed from the bottom, being the up-flow velocity the only shear force to mix the biomass. The second configuration incorporated a mechanical stirrer and a sieve to improve the biomass mixing and retention. The CFGR was operated at short hydraulic retention times (HRT) which ranged from 11 to 68 min. The configuration with a mechanical stirrer and sieve was optimal in terms of biomass retention and nitrogen removal performance. Despite the low nitrogen and organic matter concentrations, granulation was achieved in 55 days, with an average granule diameter up to 0.47 mm. Ammonium and nitrite removal percentages up to 81% and 100% were achieved, respectively. The ammonium and nitrite production rate in the trout farm were lower than the removal achieved by the CFGR, which makes the implementation of this system appropriated to maintain the concentration of these compounds below toxic levels for rainbow trout SI"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2022-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.0323717E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.267654E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "2.44", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "downloads", "@score": "52", "@datasource": "opendoar____::7b7a53e239400a13bd6be6c91c4f6c4e||Reposit\u00f3rio Institucional da Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa"}, {"@id": "views", "@score": "53", "@datasource": "opendoar____::7b7a53e239400a13bd6be6c91c4f6c4e||Reposit\u00f3rio Institucional da Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Numerical Comparison of Two and Three Dimensional Flow Regimes in Porous Media"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "numerical comparison of two and three dimensional flow regimes in porous media"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>The purpose of this work is to study the fluid flow regimes in a porous media with high enough velocities (in the range of laminar flow).

At exceedence probabilities smaller than 0.1 both FORM/DIS and FORM/LHS gave more accurate results than crude Monte Carlo simulation, and this improvement increased rapidly with decreasing probabilities.

In humid areas where dew formation is frequent, estimation of energy requirements for evaporating dew should be of interest. In this study, sensible heat flux (H) was computed from wind and temperature profile measurements over the study site. A leaf wetness sensor was used to measure the duration of evaporation from an exposed leaf surface, and net radiation was measured with a radiometer. The energy flux during the period of wet leaf surface evaporation was integrated over time. A cattail lysimeter situated at the site indicated the time when evapotranspiration started after wet leaves were dry. The energy requirements to dry an exposed wet leaf surface was estimated using energy balance methods. The mean value based on 44 days of observations from mid February to early May of 1993 indicates that the energy required to evaporate dew from openly exposed wet leaves was 5 percent of the total daily evapotranspiration of cattails with a coefficient of variation of 0.72. The mean time required to evaporate dew from exposed leaf surfaces from the onset of positive net radiation was 78 minutes. The mean dew evaporation in a morning from an exposed leaf surface was 0.16 mm with a maximum value of 0.41 mm.

The yearly exceedance probability of extreme precipitation of multiple durations is crucial for infrastructure design, risk management and policymaking. Local extremes emerge from the interaction of weather systems with local terrain features such as coastlines and orography, however multi-duration extremes do not follow exactly the patterns of cumulative precipitation and are still not well understood. High-resolution information from weather radars could help us better quantifying their patterns, but traditional extreme-value analyses based on radar records were found too inaccurate for quantifying the extreme intensities for impact studies. Here, we propose a novel methodology for extreme precipitation frequency analysis based on relatively short weather radar records, and we use it to investigate coastal and orographic effects on extreme precipitation of durations between 10 minutes and 24 hours. Combining 11 years of radar data with 10-minute rain gauge data in the southeastern Mediterranean, we obtain estimates of the 1 in 100 years intensities with ~22\u2009% standard error, which is lower than those obtained using traditional approaches on rain gauge data. We identify three distinct regimes, which respond differently to coastal and orographic forcing: short durations (~10 minutes), related to peak convective rain rates; hourly durations (~1 hours), related to the yield of individual convective cells; and long durations (~6\u201324 hours), related to the accumulation of multiple convective cells and to stratiform processes. At short and hourly durations, extreme return levels peak at the coastline, while at longer durations they peak corresponding to the orographic barriers. The distributions tail heaviness is rather uniform above the sea and rapidly changes in presence of orography, with opposing directions at short (decreasing tail heaviness, with a peak at hourly durations) and long (increasing) durations. These distinct effects suggest that short-scale hazards such as urban pluvial floods could be more of concern for the coastal regions, while longer-scale hazards such as flash floods could be more relevant in mountainous areas.                         </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-08-09"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.4992604E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.1416067E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "20", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "14.16", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "20", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Response to comment on \u201cAveraging theory for description of environmental problems: What have we learned?\u201d"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "response to comment on averaging theory for description of environmental problems what have we learned"}], "abstract": {"$": "abstract 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The research site was a small upland catchment area on Dartmoor (Southwest England). It was shown that overland flow on the tracks and paths created by animals in the area responded very rapidly to rainfall, in the same order of magnitude as stream runoff. Livestock stocking densities were significantly different in different vegetation compositions. The topsoil bulk density values, moisture content and spatial track densities were significantly higher in areas associated with higher stocking rates. These areas reach a wetness threshold at an earlier state than surrounding, drier areas. When isolated, the wetter areas start discharging water only locally into downslope drier areas, but are not contributing to storm runoff in the stream. In areas with a high density of animal tracks, water is being discharged onto the track directly. The tracks comprised an ephemeral hydrological network contributing storm runoff to the stream quickly after rainfall. They transmit water rapidly downhill, short\u2010circuiting local areas, reducing runoff lag time and increasing storm stream runoff. The runoff producing mechanism, in which soil conditions, vegetation types and path networks are a complex interplay of contributing factors, may be relevant to other uplands, especially when they act as water reservoir or source area for possible flooding events.

It is then used in Darcy-based simulations for all dynamic conditions. This is only valid if there is a guarantee that this relationship is unique for a given flow process (drainage or imbibition) independent of dynamic conditions; (b) It is also known that P c\u2013S w relationship is flow process dependent.

The results show that the average remote sensing ecological index of Shanghai in 2020 increased obviously compared with that in 2016. In addition, Jinshan District, Songjiang District, and Qingpu District have higher ecological environment quality, while Hongkou District, Jingan District, and Huangpu District have lower ecological environment quality. In addition, the ecological environment of all districts has a significant positive spatial autocorrelation. These findings suggest that the ecological environment of Shanghai has improved overall in the past five years. In addition, Hongkou District, Jingan District, and Huangpu District should put more effort into improving the ecological environment in future, and the improvement of ecological environment should consider the impact of surrounding districts. Moreover, the proposed weight setting method is more reasonable, and the proposed evaluation method is convenient and practical.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-10-13"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.064398E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.3806054E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "2.32", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The radii inversion problem associated with the Hg capillary pressure experiment"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the radii inversion problem associated with the hg capillary pressure experiment"}], "abstract": {"$": "Today's practice of interpreting Hg capillary pressure curves \u2014 a widespread method in porosimetry \u2014 is generally unsatisfactory.

Here, a methodology based on data-driven simulation model, multi-objective optimization model, multi-criterion decision making model, and social choice method is suggested to find the optimal design parameters of detention rockfill dam. This methodology adapts data to model and model to optimum design variables.

The experiments performed in 40 different geometrical configurations revealed various two-dimensional flow characteristics in the bank cavities created by the roughness elements compared to the prismatic reference channel. The overall head loss of the flow is governed by the existence of different phenomena, such as vertical mixing layers, wake zones, recirculation gyres, coherent structures, and skin friction. The analysis of the experiments for steady flow conditions showed that the flow resistance is significantly increased in the macrorough configurations because of the disturbance of the bank geometry inducing large-scale depressions. The additional flow resistance attributable to macroroughness has been related to the forms of the banks.

We were able to satisfactorily replicate observed flow routes using a simple steepest-descent-with-overtopping model with a 5 m DEM. This was unexpected, considering the narrowness of linear LEs such as paths and tracks. However LE attributes showed considerable sensitivity: changing just one attribute of a single FE-flow interaction notably altered the route taken by simulated flow, while changing LE attributes notably affected synthetic hydrographs for flow reaching the river, suggesting similar impacts upon transported sediment reaching the river. Thus while simple steepest-descent and overtopping permits satisfactory replication of observed flow routes, it is likely that more explicit representation of LE-flow interactions is necessary in order to adequately capture the dynamics of field-to-river runoff and sediment transport, as must be done by catchment-scale erosion models. This will enable such models to better represent runoff speed and volume, and the flux and size distribution of transported sediment, with the aim of overcoming some broad limitations of such models as noted in earlier model validation studies.

These dissolution models were largely developed through laboratory column experiments. To gain insight into the implications of various representations of the local-scale kinetic as well as equilibrium DNAPL dissolution processes, aquifer heterogeneity and the complex architecture of a DNAPL source-zone, the aqueous-phase contaminant concentrations and mass fluxes arriving at a down-gradient compliance boundary are analyzed in a conditional stochastic framework. The hydrogeologic setting is a heterogeneous fluvial aquifer in Southwest Germany, referred to as the aquifer analog dataset, that was intensively characterized in three dimensions for hydrogeological parameters that include permeability, effective porosity, grain size, mineralogy and sorption coefficients. By embedding the various dissolution models into the compositional, multiphase flow model, CompFlow, the relative times predicted for complete depletion of a released DNAPL source due to natural dissolution are explored. Issues related to achieving environmental benefits through, for example, partial DNAPL-zone source removal via enhanced remedial technologies are also discussed. In this context, performance metrics in the form of peak aqueous-phase contaminant concentrations and mass fluxes arriving at a down-gradient compliance boundary are compared to each other. This is done for each of the alternative mass transfer models. A significant reduction in the fractional flux at a downstream location from the DNAPL source can be achieved by partial source-zone mass reduction; however, peak concentration levels at the same location remain much higher than the United States Environment Protection Agency (US-EPA) drinking water limits.

The simplifications are that flow from the bottom of the borehole is neglected (therefore the solution is applicable to slender boreholes, where the ponding depth is at least 10 times the radius) and capillarity can be modeled with a quasi-linear approach. The Green's function approach leads to an integral equation, the solution of which does not show significant ill-posedness. Two sub-cases are presented: the first neglects capillary effects (the all-saturated approximation) and the second (general solution) takes them into account. The all-saturated solution is successfully tested against finite element simulations. The corresponding values of the borehole shape factor C are slightly larger than the ones obtained with approximate analytical solutions from the literature. When capillarity is accounted for, C changes of a factor of 10 when the dimensionless sorptive number A goes from typical values for fine soils to typical values for coarse soils (about two orders of magnitude of variation for A). This range shifts to lower values of A as the dimensionless borehole depth increases. Consequently, the all-saturated solution is a good approximation of the soil behavior for boreholes with large ponding depth, and coarse soils.

Numerical simulations of steady-state flow show that the predicted discharge based on the Forchheimer's equation agrees better with measurements than that based on the Darcy's law by ~27%. The region with the most pronounced non-Darcian effect occurs at the intersection between the tunnel and a karstified fault connecting to an underground river, and the occurrence of non-Darcian flow leads to an increase in hydraulic gradient, but a reduction in discharge into the tunnel.

In the results from the bathymetric investigation and software analysis, annually 28,641.675\u00a0m3\u00a0year\u22121 amount of sediment is coming from the catchments to the reservoir that contributed 1.66% of annual reservoir volume reduction. The measured recent storing capacity for the Abrajit Dam was 1,388,870\u00a0m3. From a comparison of remaining reservoir storage and annual sediment load, the reservoir will not serve more than 12\u00a0years. The estimated specific sediment yield (SSy) was found to be 4733.387\u00a0ton\u00a0km\u22122\u00a0year\u22121. Therefore, to improve the estimated life span of the reservoir, watershed management is very important and further study is required to identify the area where watershed conservation will focus in the future. Upon the findings, the reservoir volume is running to reduce and it cannot serve all the demand what it designed for during the dry season. As a result, operation curves should be mandatory to give water service for the critical water needs, and regular monitoring of sediment accumulation in the reservoir is recommended."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-10-30"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.1389957E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.572037E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "8", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "5.76", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of the Inorganic Materials Changes with Time in the Stages of the Wastewater Treatment Plant"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "qualitative and quantitative analysis of the inorganic materials changes with time in the stages of the wastewater treatment plant"}], "abstract": {"$": "Due to the importance of the inorganic materials removal from wastewater, experimental and analytical study to the concentration change with time of these materials became essential.

The proposed approach overcomes deficiencies in the conventional correlation\u2013regression approach used to assess and eventually reduce the number of water quality variables in WQM networks. For the reduction of water quality variables, criteria developed from record-augmentation procedures are integrated with correlation analysis and cluster analysis to identify highly associated water quality variables. This step is followed by the application of an information performance index to systematically identify the optimal combination of variables to be continuously measured and those to be discontinued. The linear regression and maintenance of variance (MOVE) record-extension techniques are employed to reconstitute information about discontinued variables. The proposed approach is applied for rationalization of the water quality variables in the Nile Delta surface WQM network in Egypt.

Benchmarking is a valuable tool that has proven itself in the business and commercial sector, as well as in public sector enterprises. This paper describes and defines the benchmarking process, and goes on to outline its current application in the irrigation and drainage (I&amp;D) sector. The paper highlights the difficulty of benchmarking in the I&amp;D sector given the complexity and site\u2010specific nature of irrigation and drainage systems, and emphasises the need for careful identification of which processes to benchmark. Preliminary benchmarking indicators are discussed, and attention drawn to efforts currently under way to apply and test this preliminary set. Emphasis is placed on the effort and resources required to bring about the required changes identified by the benchmarking exercise, and the role of change management as an integral part of the benchmarking process. The paper concludes that benchmarking provides a feasible mechanism for performance improvement in the I&amp;D sector, but requires the active involvement of motivated individuals with support from the wider environment, encompassing an enabling socio\u2010political environment and support from key stakeholders.

This study proposes a risk-based aggregation-decomposition method for floodwater utilization of a complex multi-reservoir system. The original system is decomposed into four basic configurations. For the subsystem with hydraulic connections, the upper bound of FLWL of each reservoir is identified based on a given risk level for the subsystem and risk hedging between reservoirs. A stochastic programming model to maximize hydropower generation is then established for joint operation of the multi-reservoir system to find and update the optimal operation strategy during flood seasons. The mixed cascade reservoirs in the Pi River Basin are selected as a case study. The application results are compared with those of the original design model and deterministic operation model without considering risk, which shows that joint operation and dynamic control of FLWLs: 1) significantly increases the power generation and improves the utilization rate of floodwaters compared to those of the original design model; 2) power production rate increases with the acceptable risk but the increasing rate between them decreases with higher levels of risk; 3) results in lower utilization rate of floodwaters compared to that of the deterministic model, but the difference is not significant.

Historically, the streamline method has been unable toaccount for gravity effects. This is a result of assuming that the fluid path follows thestreamline path and therefore no communication among streamlines. However with gravity,a fluid pathline is different from a fluid streamline. Each phase can move vertically asa result of the gravity segregation effect in addition to the flow along streamline.Gravity effects are accounted in the streamline method by an operator splitting technique.The idea is to isolate the convective flow from diffusion due to gravity for separatesolutions. The convective part is calculated along the common streamline trajectories andthe diffusion part is determined by the direction of gravity. While this has been done successfullyfor isothermal problems, it is still a challenge to obtain both accuracy and efficiencyfor non-isothermal flow. This paper further examines the mixed streamline methodwith an operator splitting technique for this class of problems. The pressure equation fordefining streamlines was derived by summing up the mass conservation equations. Then,the mass and heat transport equations in terms of the streamline time-of-flight coordinatewere solved for each streamline. A gravity step will be followed by solving the segregationequations over the dimensional grid. For simplification of modeling, heat was assumed totransfer by convection only, of which direction is parallel with the flowing phases and theinfluence of temperature in the simulation model is through changes in fluid viscosity only.The proposed approach was tested through simulation of heavy oil recovery by means ofhot waterflooding.

Three consecutive PPTs were performed in a monitoring well of a heating oil-contaminated aquifer in Erlen, Switzerland.

The buried anode is connected via control circuitry to a cathode exposed to oxygen in the overlying water. During metabolism, bacteria release hydrogen ions into the sediment and transfer electrons extra-cellularly to the anode, which eventually reduce dissolved oxygen at the cathode, forming water. The voltage between electrodes is operationally around 0.4 v and the current is chiefly limited by the rate of microbial metabolism at the anode. The Office of Naval Research has encouraged development of microbial fuel cells in the marine environment at a number of academic and naval institutions. Work at SPAWAR, a navy laboratory in San Diego, involves fuel cell design and testing, applications to low power, Navy sensors and studies of important environmental parameters that affect fuel cell performance. In San Diego Bay, we typically find that steady state power output is reached two to three weeks after deployment and power density ranges from 2 mW m\u22122 to 15 mW m\u22122 anode surface area. In order to determine which parameters are controlling power output, we developed small, self-recording fuel cells that could be deployed and retrieved from the surface - the \u2018sea dart\u2019. Typical sea dart deployments lasted two weeks. We combined data from the sea dart with oxygen, sediment and water temperature, and water depth data from simultaneously deployed instruments in many instances. We took additional data on sediment total organic carbon and grain size. For longer time series, we evaluated data from a much larger, self-recording fuel cell at one location for five months where the main environmental variant was seasonal water temperature. We found that the most important environmental parameters that control fuel cell power output in San Diego Bay were total organic carbon in the sediment and seasonal water temperature. Parameters that we dismissed were dissolved oxygen levels, light level, and initial sediment bacterial populations. Parameters whose affect we could not separate were total organic carbon and grain size. Surprisingly, we also found that power density is inversely proportional to anode size, perhaps due to internal anode resistance or interference with local pore water diffusion of organics to the bacterial population. Derived relationships between power and organic carbon, temperature and anode size, along with extensive knowledge of sediment organic carbon and seasonal water temperatures in San Diego Bay, allowed us to develop seasonal contours of power output from a benthic microbial fuel cell with a nominal 1 m2 anode. As an application, these contours were then translated into charging time for a satellite transmitter with a 10 minute transmission window."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2011-09-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.7865546E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.2241986E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "6", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.15192407", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY OF WATER\u2010CURRENT MIETERS<sup>1</sup>"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "accuracy and consistency of water current mieters"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> The measurement of discharge in natural streams requires hydrographers to use accurate meters that have consistent performance among meters of the same model.

Reliable groundwater flow simulations require a sound understanding of the hydrogeological structure of the subsurface materials. However, a detailed model of the hydrological structure of thick unconsolidated basin sediments is often limited by their inaccessible nature, especially in the deep domain. As a result, deep regional flow is generally neglected in traditional groundwater flow simulations. This study presents an integrated approach for developing a model of hydrogeological structures using multiple data sources, including audio-magnetotelluric data (AMT), borehole data, and the interpreted lower boundary of Quaternary sediments. The approach overcomes the disadvantages of using the depth of boreholes as the lower boundary of the hydrogeological system and may be used to analyse the effects of hydrogeological structures on groundwater flow simulations. The model, which utilized sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) and natural neighbor interpolation (NNI), was evaluated by application to a typical cross-section through the Yinchuan Basin, China, to a depth of 1,700\u202fm. The horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Kx) field was calibrated using observation wells and the PEST pilot points (PPP) method. The effects of the developed hydrogeological structure on groundwater flow simulations were evaluated for the entire thickness of Quaternary sediments (complete-domain model, CDM) as well as for sediments above the maximum depth of the boreholes (shallow-domain model, SDM). In addition, the sensitivity of the Kx field on groundwater flow patterns was analysed. The results show that the proposed approach can characterize the spatial distribution of lithologic units and the heterogeneity of hydrogeological parameters in the deep domain (>300\u202fm), as well as avoid the multi-solution problem of inferring hydrogeological parameters from geophysical data. It can also improve the accuracy of the hydrogeological structure model and the reliability of groundwater flow simulations. The adjustment of the hydrogeological structure affects the flow budget as well as the pattern of the groundwater flow systems (including the type of system, and their number, location, and extent). Changes in the Kx field affect the local flow field, whereas adjustment of the hydrogeological structure model affects the global flow field."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-09-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.1988914E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.1785309E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "5.84", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "10", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Anthropogenic Impacts on a Bedrock Aquifer at the Village Scale"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Anthropogenic impacts on a bedrock aquifer at the village scale."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "anthropogenic impacts on a bedrock aquifer at the village scale"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study focuses on assessing groundwater potability in a highly complex and heterogeneous fractured bedrock aquifer having variable overburden cover.

Changes in the sand filter, due to the removal of suspended particles from the water and their accumulation in the pores, result in an increase of the bulk density and acoustic speed of the granular material. Consequently, the reflected acoustic response changes as the filter is in use. To monitor these changes, an instrument composed of an omnidirectional transmitter and an array of hydrophones was built. With frequencies ranging between 10 and 110 kHz, high resolution is achieved in the vertical direction enabling the detectability of clogged layers with a minimum thickness of 1 cm. The novel instrument is tested by conducting a monitoring experiment in a filter used in practice. A 2D scan over a part of the filter was performed and repeated every 2 hours over a period of 10 days. An analysis of the data revealed a local increase of the reflected acoustic response with increasing filter run time. The changes in acoustic signal are mainly observed at the upper 5 cm of the sand bed. It is also clear that the filter bed is slowly compacting as a function of time. The total compaction after a period of 10 days reached 3.5 cm. The filter bed is expanded again during the cleaning procedure. Once the procedure is completed, the upper 30 cm of the filter becomes more transparent, showing small accumulations of material at greater depth. The observed changes in the filter bed demonstrate the potential of this acoustic-based tool to monitor the state of rapid sand filters and optimise their performance. The new tool can be used to evaluate the cleaning procedure and is valuable in detecting lateral variations in the filter bed. These variations may indicate local clogging that needs to be removed effectively to avoid deterioration of the overall performance in the long term.

We investigated three hypotheses that could explain wetland disappearance: (1) dune movement during a severe drought in the 1950s buried the wetlands, (2) agriculture related ground water pumping lowered the regional water table, and (3) changes in local hydrologic processes led to wetland loss. We used regional stream flow records, ground water level measurements, natural stable isotope analyses, soil stratigraphy, buried seed banks, and ground water modeling to address these hypotheses.  Hydrologic data and stable isotope analyses illustrated the interaction between Sand Creek, a nearby stream, and the unconfined aquifer in the area where wetlands occurred. When the intermittent Sand Creek flows, seepage through its bed creates a large ground water mound under the creek. The seasonal development and dispersion of this mound propagates pressure waves through the aquifer that influence ground water levels up to 2\u00a0km from Sand Creek. Our data suggest the primary factors contributing to wetland disappearance were recent climatic fluctuations and incision of the Sand Creek channel. Below average stream flow between 1950 and 1980 reduced the duration of Sand Creek flow across the dune complex, minimizing ground water mound development. Consequently, the water table in the unconfined aquifer dropped \u223c1.0\u00a0m and interdunal wetlands dried up. Twentieth Century incision of Sand Creek's channel reduced ground water mound height \u223c2.5\u00a0m, decreasing seasonal water table fluctuations at interdunal wetlands and contributing to the overall water table decline. Long-term wet and dry cycles affect the water table elevation more than channel incision, leading us to conclude that many interdunal wetlands are ephemeral features.

The study results show that plots with no soil conservation measures had the highest runoff depth of 75 mm and suffered the highest sediment loss, at a rate of 3200 t km\u22122 yr\u22121. The terraced and vegetated plots generated lower runoff depths, with soil loss rates less than 213.0 t km\u22122 yr\u22121. With the exception of the contour tillage plots on steep slopes, the vegetation and engineering measures can efficiently reduce runoff and sediment loss, with both runoff and sediment reduction efficiencies higher than 76%. Statistical analyses indicate that, on the plots of bare soil and cultivation without soil conservation measures, runoff and sediment loss were mainly affected by the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity. However, on the plots with soil conservation measures, they were mainly determined by rainfall amount and duration. The sediment loss rate can be well fitted with the runoff depth using a power function. Based on the analyses, water-saving soil conservation measures are recommended for the study area. In addition, the size of terraces should be reconsidered on gentle slopes, and the coverage of forest, shrubs, and grass on slopes should be reduced, thus allowing for more surface runoff generation to ensure drinking water safety. In general, for the study area, soil conservation measures are required on the bare soil and cultivated slopes.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-09-11"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9344591E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.0231552E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "2.2", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Optimal Number of Pressure Sensors for Real-Time Monitoring of Distribution Networks by Using the Hypervolume Indicator"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "optimal number of pressure sensors for real time monitoring of distribution networks by using the hypervolume indicator"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>This article proposes a novel methodology to determine the optimal number of pressure sensors for the real-time monitoring of water distribution networks based on a quality hypervolume indicator.

However, such models are subject to large uncertainties in model parameters, the physical model itself and in available measured data, which is often rare. Thus, the robustness and reliability of the computer model and its outcomes largely depend on successful parameter estimation and model calibration, which are often hampered by the computational burden of large-scale coupled models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To tackle this problem, we present a novel Bayesian approach for parameter estimation, which allows to account for different sources of uncertainty, is capable of dealing with sparse field data and makes optimal use of the output data from computationally expensive numerical model runs. This is achieved by combining output data from different models that represent the same physical problem, but at different levels of fidelity, e.g. reflected by different spatial resolution, i.e. different model discretization. Our framework combines information from a few parametric model outputs from a physically accurate, but expensive, high-fidelity computer model, with a larger number of evaluations from a less expensive and less accurate low-fidelity model. This enables us to include accurate information about the model output at sparse points in the parameter space, as well as dense samples across the entire parameter space, albeit with a lower physical accuracy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We first apply the multi-fidelity approach to a simple 1D analytical heat transfer model, and secondly on a semi-3D coupled mass and heat transport numerical model, and estimate the unknown model parameters. By using synthetic data generated with known parameter values, we are able to test the reliability of the new method, as well as the improved performance over a single-fidelity approach, under different framework settings. Overall, the results from the analytical and numerical model show that combining 50 runs of the low resolution model with data from only 10 runs of a higher resolution model significantly improves the posterior distribution results, both in terms of agreement with the true parameter values and the confidence interval around this value. The next steps for further testing of the method are employing real data from field measurements and adding statistical formulations for model calibration and prediction based on the inferred posterior distributions of the estimated parameters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-11-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.2246539E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.0692947E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "5.1296", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "8", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Unraveling the heat island effect observed in urban groundwater bodies \u2013 Definition of a potential natural state"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "unraveling the heat island effect observed in urban groundwater bodies definition of a potential natural state"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:aggregator", "@trust": "0.89", "$": "Unraveling the heat island effect observed in urban groundwater bodies - Definition of a potential natural state"}], "abstract": {"$": "Summary   A superposition of several thermal processes leads to an elevation of groundwater temperatures of up to 9\u00a0\u00b0C above the natural state in the city of Basel, Switzerland.

The results indicate that the daytime and nighttime discharges were less during the preliminary stage of melting in May, and became strong following the ablation period (July-August). The daytime and nighttime discharges in the same month varied year-over-year, and the daily discharge cycles in different months of the summer were dissimilar. The mean daytime/nighttime discharges were somewhat related to the mean nighttime air temperature (T-n), but were not significantly related to the amount of precipitation. In the daily cycle of average discharges in the summer months during 2001-2005, the maximum discharges occurred in the afternoons and evenings, and the minimum discharges occurred in the mornings. The daily discharge peaks lagged behind the time of maximum melting (maximum air temperature) on selected clear-weather days in different months in different years. This was related to the melt water flow distance inside and underneath the glacier and the structure of the internal drainage net, and may also have been influenced by the weather prior to and after the observed consecutive clear-weather days. The monthly mean daytime discharge was generally greater than the nighttime discharge, primarily because cloudy and rainy weather and lower air temperatures led to less melt water, and precipitation could not make up the loss of discharge from melt water. Daytime melt water contributed only slightly to nighttime discharge due to the short time lag caused by melt water flow distance. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

When flow enters a bend, the centrifugal force arising from the channel curvature leads to a transversal slope in the water surface. The interaction between the centrifugal force and transversal pressure gradient causes secondary flows in cross-sections, and the secondary flows spread further by moving along the bend. Hence, at the bends, these processes lead to longitudinal velocity increase in the inner wall and decrease at the outer wall. In this paper, experimentation is carried out for two different bed roughness on a 4.11 sinuosity meandering channel with 110\u00b0 crossover. Longitudinal velocity distribution is analysed with the graphical illustrations for the detailed experimental study. Study of flow profile across the crossover is also particularly important as the inner bank of the bend changes to the outer bank and vice versa which has a significant effect on the water surface profile and hence on the velocity distribution along the full meander path. The objective of the analysis is to determine the effect of curvature and roughness on the velocity profiles, throughout the meander path.

The goal of rainfall\u2013runoff modeling is to simulate the peak river flow caused by an actual or hypothetical rainfall force. In existing methods, the rainfall\u2013runoff relationships are quantified to predict the daily streamflow of each catchment from its landscape attributes to measure the daily rainfall. However, the structural model error, infiltration rate, and the steep slopes of the hill affect the prediction process. To tackle these issues, this paper proposed a novel rainfall prognostic model-based artificial framework, which predicts day-to-day rainfall to prevent environmental disasters. The day-to-day predictions minimize the risks to life and property and also manage the agricultural farms in a better way because the possibility of rainfall has been estimated earlier. Furthermore, the posterior fire-breathing network is utilized to estimate model errors in the computational runoff by using time-dependent and random noise to the model's internal storage to solve the uncertainty problem. Since the model errors are estimated, there are limits to the infiltration rate and thus a prophetic multilayer network is utilized which relies on the soil runoff levels. Moreover, the network measures the dynamics of soil moisture to regulate the infiltration rate according to the rural or urban section. Moreover, to measure the surface water from the steep slopes, the system offered a well-ordered selective genetic algorithm to calculate the velocity of runoff in different bend areas to overcome the numerical problem. Thus, the model results showed that the work effectively predicts the rainfall from the investigation of model errors, infiltration rates, and velocity to achieve a better prediction range in the rainfall.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2022-09-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.868677E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.439509E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Water Distribution Network Sectorisation Using Structural Graph Partitioning and Multi-objective Optimization"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "water distribution network sectorisation using structural graph partitioning and multi objective optimization"}], "abstract": {"$": "AbstractPartitioning a water distribution network (WDN) into smaller sub-networks (called district metered areas, or DMAs) is a strategy to manage its complexity.

Of particular concern is the heightened level and mobilization of Se influenced by nitrate (NO3), a harmful pollutant in its own right. We present a numerical model that simulates the reactive transport of Se and nitrogen (N) species in a coupled groundwater-surface water system. Building upon a conceptual model that incorporates the major processes affecting Se and NO3 transport in an irrigated watershed, the model links the finite-difference models MODFLOW, UZF-RT3D, and OTIS, to simulate flow and reactive transport of multiple chemical species in both the aquifer and a stream network, with mass exchange between the two.

One of the challenges in this field is the scalability of the problem size, whereby large micro-CT images over the order of 10003 voxels incur a high computational demand on performance. We estimate the of permeability in large digital samples of rocks imaged by micro-CT by using a fast and efficient Dual Grid Domain Decomposition technique based on the Schwarz Alternating Method (slow, low memory) with Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) solvers (fast, high memory) to solve on an otherwise unfeasible shared-memory machine. The comparisons and differences to other methods commonly used have been added in the introduction. The method applies a scalable parallel simulation algorithm to solve pressure and velocity fields using the Semi Analytical Pore Scale Finite Volume Solver (PFVS) within real 3D pore-scale micro-CT images. The domain is split into non-overlapping coarse partitions and also split into a set of dual coarse partitions of varying width. The governing equations are then solved iteratively between the partition sets by updating the pressure and flux at the relevant boundaries before each step. The method is validated and shown to converge to flux continuous conditions requisite of the governing equations. Permeability estimation is within 5\u201310% of the fine scale solution and significantly reduces memory limitations and computational time for solving problems in micro-CT images, allowing ordinary workstations to solve images over 10003 within the magnitude of 1\u2013100\u00a0h of CPU time.

SBDTs are applicable in all aquifer types, but especially interesting in heterogeneous karst or fractured aquifers. Uniform injections aim at a homogeneous tracer concentration throughout the entire saturated length and provide information about inflow and outflow horizons. Also, in the absence of vertical flow, horizontal filtration velocities can be calculated. The most common method for uniform injections uses a hosepipe to inject the tracer. This report introduces a simplified method that uses a permeable injection bag (PIB) to achieve a close-to-uniform tracer distribution within the saturated zone. To evaluate the new method and to identify advantages and disadvantages, several tests have been carried out, in the laboratory and in multiple groundwater monitoring wells in the field. Reproducibility of the PIB method was assessed through repeated tests, on the basis of the temporal development of salt amount and calculated apparent filtration velocities. Apparent filtration velocities were calculated using linear regression as well as by inverting the one-dimensional (1D) advection-dispersion equation using CXTFIT. The results show that uniform-injection SBDTs with the PIB method produce valuable and reproducible outcomes and contribute to the understanding of groundwater monitoring wells and the respective aquifer.

Using the calibrated model, we then assessed the quality of short-range (24\u201372 h) deterministic forecasts of daily quickflow in both watersheds over a 2-yr period (July 2017\u2013October 2019). At the basin outlet, HL-RDHM quickflow simulations showed low biases (PBIAS = 10.5%) and strong agreement (KGE\u2033 = 0.81) with observations. At the headwater scale, HL-RDHM overestimated quickflow (PBIAS = 69.0%) to a greater degree, but quickflow simulations remained satisfactory (KGE\u2033 = 0.65). When applied to quickflow forecasting, HL-RDHM produced skillful forecasts (&gt;90% of Peirce and Gerrity skill scores above 0.5) at all lead times and significantly outperformed persistence forecasts, although skill gains in Mahantango Creek were slightly lower.

Recently, extending similar approaches in discrete time, a continuous time autoregressive error model was proposed for statistical inference and uncertainty analysis in hydrologic modeling. The major advantages over discrete time formulation are the use of a continuous time error model for describing continuous processes, the possibility of accounting for seasonal variations of parameters in the error model, the easier treatment of missing data or omitted outliers, and the opportunity for continuous time predictions. The model was developed for the Chaohe Basin in China and had some features specific for this semiarid climatic region (in particular, the seasonal variation of parameters in the error model in response to seasonal variation in precipitation). This paper tests and extends this approach with an application to the Thur River basin in Switzerland, which is subject to completely different climatic conditions. This application corroborates the general applicability of the approach but also demonstrates the necessity of accounting for the heavy tails in the distributions of residuals and innovations. This is done by replacing the normal distribution of the innovations by a Student <jats:italic>t</jats:italic> distribution, the degrees of freedom of which are adapted to best represent the shape of the empirical distribution of the innovations. We conclude that with this extension, the continuous time autoregressive error model is applicable and flexible for hydrologic modeling under different climatic conditions. The major remaining conceptual disadvantage is that this class of approaches does not lead to a separate identification of model input and model structural errors.

The work aimed firstly to provide adequate models for long-term streamflow prediction in nine catchments of this Basin feeding the Hume and Dartmouth reservoirs. The development and testing of flow forecasting algorithms for operational management by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission was another purpose of the work reported here. The conceptual lumped parameter rainfall-runoff model IHACRES (Jakeman et al., 1990, 1993; Jakeman and Hornberger, 1993) was selected as the modelling tool for streamflow prediction in the catchments. The conceptual rainfall-runoff model IHACRES (with a snow melt/formation module in snow-affected catchments) and a self- adaptive linear filtering approach for the IHACRES residuals were combined and applied for forecasting daily streamflow in the Upper Murray Basin catchments. Different orders of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for the residuals were considered in order to select the most appropriate forecasting algorithm. Linear filtering of the conceptual model residuals provides considerable improvement in forecasting for both low and high values of streamflow for developing the operational streamflow forecast system. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, coupled effects of high pH and chemical heterogeneity on colloid retention and release in saturated porous media remain unclear. We studied colloid transports in acid treated/untreated glass beads under various high pH values and ionic strength (IS) conditions to elucidate the effect of high pH and chemical heterogeneity. Chemical impurities promote the colloid to attach to the primary minimum. Increasing environmental pH of solutions would weaken the colloidal retention capacity. Once pH increases to 11, almost no colloid retention occurs no matter chemical impurities exist or not. Adsorbed colloids in the primary minimum can be detached at high pH environments (from 10 to 12). Despite the final similar environmental pH (from 10 to 12), different amounts of colloids are reserved at the ends of the attaching processes and eluting processes. Effects of chemical impurities on colloid retention are negligible when pH\u2009=\u200910 or higher. At the same time, colloid release in high pH solution is also related to disabled chemical impurities. Although previous studies show no obvious rule about colloid release with changing pH (from 6.8\u201310), our results demonstrate significant coupled effects of high pH and chemical heterogeneity on colloid retention and release in saturated porous media.

Parameter model calibration and validation were performed for rainfall events under similar conditions, examined in pairs, in order to verify two hydrological models, the lumped HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center\u2019s Hydrologic Modeling System model) and the semi-distributed HBV-light (a recent version of Hydrologiska Byr\u00e5ns Vattenbalansavdelning model), at the exit of six individual gauged sub-basins.

Different time of concentration (Tc) formulas are better applied to the sub-watersheds with respect to the dominant land uses, classifying the Tc among the most sensitive parameters that influence the time of appearance and the magnitude of the peak modeled flow through the HEC-HMS model. The maximum water content of the soil box (FC) affects most the peak flow via the HBV-light model, whereas the MAXBAS parameter has the greatest effect on the displayed time of peak discharge. The modeling results show that the HBV-light performed better in the events that had less precipitation volume compared to their pairs. The event with the higher total precipitated water produced better results with the HEC-HMS model, whereas the rest of the two high precipitation events performed satisfactorily with both models.

Following the addition of ions to the snow surface, either as snow or later in the season as rain, the elution sequence is reproduced. Comparison of leachate chemistry with stream chemistry samples taken at the basin outlet indicate that snow pack melt water contributes directly to stream water. The stream water chemistry signal is, however, noisy and the stream concentrations are considerably damped relative to the snowpack leachate. This is thought to be a consequence of differential melting within the catchment as the snowpack at lower altitudes is at a more advanced stage of melt and so holds fewer solutes and mixing with groundwater contributions. Temperature observations at different altitudes within the catchment support this interpretation.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1993-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.0959383E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.9291E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "23", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.3245878", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Moving socio-hydrologic modelling forward: unpacking hidden assumptions, values and model structure by engaging with stakeholders: reply to \u201cWhat is the role of the model in socio-hydrology?\u201d"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "moving socio hydrologic modelling forward unpacking hidden assumptions values and model structure by engaging with stakeholders reply to what is the role of the model in socio hydrology"}], "abstract": {"$": "The arguments presented in Melsen et al. advance ideas in the \u201cPanta Rhei\u201d decade (2013\u20132022) of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences, which focuses on change in hydrology and soc..."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2018-07-04"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.2099774E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.03613855E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "13", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "3.70656", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "9", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Quantifying the Impact of Compounding Influencing Factors to the Water Level Decline of China\u2019s Largest Freshwater Lake"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "quantifying the impact of compounding influencing factors to the water level decline of china s largest freshwater lake"}], "abstract": {"$": "AbstractAs a large open lake that connects to the lower Yangtze River, the Poyang Lake, China, has persisted dramatic water level decline since 2003.

We have measured at several test sites across five European countries, all characterized by unconsolidated sediments, but with differences in terms of the water electrical conductivity. In particular, at the Zeeland site in the Netherlands, a strong gradient in the water electrical conductivity is present since a freshwater lens is overlaying the sea water. A very good agreement between the hydraulic conductivity values from the inversion with the present hydraulic model can be observed, despite of the high water electrical conductivity, which makes it challenging to identify the clay layers at the site.

A three-dimensional (3D) numerical model was used to simulate the impact of different well-field configurations on pump-and-treat mass removal for heterogeneous domains. The relationship between reduction in contaminant mass discharge (CMDR) and mass removal (MR) was used as the metric to examine remediation efficiency. The impacts of well-field configuration on mass removal behavior are attributed to mass-transfer constraints related to regions of low flow associated with the well field, which can be muted by the influence of permeability heterogeneity. These impacts are reflected in the associated CMDR-MR profiles. Systems whose CDMR-MR profiles are below the 1:1 relationship line are associated with more efficient well-field configurations. The impact of domain heterogeneity on mass-removal effectiveness was investigated in terms of both variance and correlation scale of the random permeability distributions and indexed by the CMDR-MR relationship. Data collected from pump-and-treat operations conducted in a section of the Tucson International Airport Area (TIAA) federal Superfund site were used as a case study.

This depends on the characteristics of the rainfall events, such as spatial variability, and on other characteristics of the sewer system and the catchment.

Comparison of the first and second central moment to the results from classical numerical first\u2010order second\u2010moment (FOSM) analysis reveals that FOSM predicts these moments surprisingly close for hydraulic heads.

Our study illustrates that in contrast to the common assumption, FOSM is a reasonable choice for evaluating multivariate and univariate moments for heads, if used in conjunction with additional information on distribution shapes.

Sometimes, it can be difficult to calculate the likelihood itself in hydrological modelling, specially working with complex models or with ungauged catchments. Therefore, we propose the ABC post-processor that exchanges the requirement of calculating the likelihood function by the use of some sufficient summary statistics and synthetic datasets. The aim is to show that the conditional predictive distribution is qualitatively similar produced by the exact predictive (MCMC post-processor) or the approximate predictive (ABC post-processor). We also use MCMC post-processor as a benchmark to make results more comparable with the proposed method. We test the ABC post-processor in two scenarios: (1) the Aipe catchment with tropical climate and a spatially-lumped hydrological model (Colombia) and (2) the Oria catchment with oceanic climate and a spatially-distributed hydrological model (Spain).

The aim of this study is to evaluate such uncertainties based on Bayesian approach. The method is used to analyze hydrological drought in the East River basin (China), which is the principal supplier of water resources for megacities in the Pearl River Delta and also for Hong Kong. The results indicate that the credible intervals of most likely design drought events with a return period of 20\u00a0years in terms of drought severity and duration are considerably large at all stations in the East River basin, covering the drought event curves at return periods of 10 and 50\u00a0years. Also the influences of heavy-tailed marginal distribution on the uncertainty evaluation of joint distribution have been investigated. Results show that the stronger the heavy-tailed marginal distribution, the greater the uncertainty of the joint distribution, especially for the extreme event.

Quantitative assessment of the effects of meadow patch coverage (MPC) on the runoff and sediment processes in alpine meadow is urgent for predicting the water conservation function of this special alpine ecosystem. Here, a field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different meadow patch coverage through runoff and sediment processes in a typical alpine meadow on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that runoff in 30% and 60% MPC plots were 39.4% and 37.9% less than in 90% MPC plot, respectively. The sediment yield in 60% and 90% MPC plots were 77.9% and 82.1% less than in 30% MPC plot, respectively. The sediment concentration in 30% MPC in heavy rainfall scenario is 4.34 times and 6.51 times higher than that in light rainfall scenario and moderate rainfall scenario, respectively. Our results indicated that MPC presented a greater impact on sediment yield than runoff volume, although runoff was greatly affected by rainfall. The higher MPC followed the greater runoff coefficient and the lower sediment concentration. The influences of MPC on runoff and sediment yield in light rainfall scenario and moderate rainfall scenario were weaker than those in heavy rainfall scenario.

Rainfall erosivity is the power of rainfall to cause soil erosion by water.

However, these data are often unavailable in many areas of the world. The purpose of this study was to develop models based on commonly available rainfall data resolutions, such as daily or monthly totals, to calculate rainfall erosivity. Eleven stations with 1 min temporal resolution rainfall data collected from 1961 through 2000 in the eastern half of China were used to develop and calibrate 21 models. Seven independent stations, also with 1 min data, were utilized to validate those models, together with 20 previously published equations.

Using symmetric mean absolute percentage errors and Nash\u2013Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients, we can recommend 17 of the new models that had model efficiencies \u2265 0.59. The best prediction capabilities resulted from using the finest resolution rainfall data as inputs at a given erosivity timescale and by summing results from equations for finer erosivity timescales where possible.

First, there is a transition in fine particle loading rate as a function of discharge for gravel-bedded sediments that does not appear when the sediment bed is composed of sand, cobbles, boulders, or bedrock. Second, the discharge at the transition in the loading rate is correlated with the initiation of gravel mobilization. Third, high frequency particle concentration and discharge data are dominated by clockwise hysteresis where rising limb discharges generally have higher concentrations than falling limb discharges. These three observations across multiple watersheds lead to a conceptual model that fine particles accumulate within the sediment bed at discharges less than the transition and then the gravel bed fluidizes with fine particle release at discharges above the transition discharge.

Bulk density and porosity values were similar to values reported in the literature; difference between species and location within the peatland were observed, with the largest difference being found between <jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic> growing in open and treed areas. Particle density, however, averaged 0.75\u00a0g cm<jats:sup>\u20133</jats:sup>, or nearly half that of the assumed value from the literature, suggesting strongly that assuming 1.4\u00a0g cm<jats:sup>\u20133</jats:sup> is incorrect for <jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic> litter and that peatland practitioners should use a locally obtained value, or 0.75\u00a0g cm<jats:sup>\u20133</jats:sup> instead.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-10-11"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.2469303E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.1804624E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "7.12", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "10", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Variability in the Wettability and Water Storage Capacity of Common Oak Leaves (Quercus robur L.)"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "variability in the wettability and water storage capacity of common oak leaves quercus robur l"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>The canopy water storage capacity and wettability of the plant material are significantly dependent on the condition of the leaf surface.

Oak powdery mildew has the largest influence on the canopy water storage capacity and on hydrophobicity. In September, the leaves retained an average of 7.2 g/g more water than in May; and, in the leaves from the city, the canopy water storage capacity was 3.1 g/g higher.

Facing this fact, people concerned with the use of either pesticides or groundwater are preoccupied with understanding and predicting such risks of contamination. Some of the current approaches are aimed at evaluating the degree of vulnerability of the resource to contamination, mainly through indexation methods. Other approaches consist of modeling the processes that control the migration of contaminants in soil; these are mostly mathematical models for transport simulation. While the latter approaches are based on processes, the former usually rely solely on certain parameters and characteristics of the medium.  The DRASTIC rating system, one of several indexation methods, offers a version adapted for agricultural use. Among the currently available simulation models, the PRZM model has been specifically developed to simulate the fate of pesticides. Results from these two methods were compared, attempting to identify a correlation between the pesticide DRASTIC index and the leaching quantities provided by the PRZM model. No significant correlation was found between their results. The only factors taken into account in both methods that influence the correlation of the results, are the depth to groundwater and the vadose zone media type. The most significant conclusion resulting from this work is that chemical characteristics of the potential contaminants, which are not considered in the DRASTIC index, are important, if not critical, when evaluating the vulnerability or the potential for contamination of groundwater by agricultural chemicals. In addition, simulation models appear to be the best tools for evaluating the groundwater vulnerability, because they quantify this pollution potential in terms of physical magnitudes, like contaminant concentrations, which can be compared with water quality criteria."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1989-08-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "7.125175E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "6.3564216E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "28", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.4321522", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Drivers and challenges to water tariff reform in Saudi Arabia"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "drivers and challenges to water tariff reform in saudi arabia"}], "abstract": {"$": "In 2015, increases in the domestic water tariff in Saudi Arabia were met with significant opposition.

Both the characterization of these impacts on distribution systems and the design of contamination warning system (CWS) sensor networks rely on models that vary widely in detail and representation of the actual system. A complete representation of the distribution system for even a medium-sized city can be enormously complex. Macro skeletonization is used to describe the aggregation of the network\u2019s nodes and pipes. Micro skeletonization is used to describe the aggregation of all post-service connection piping and system detail to the model node. Models typically do not include information (pipe detail) beyond the service connection. In water systems dominated by multi-story buildings, such as commercial and residential high-rise buildings, considerable infrastructure (pipes, pumps, and tanks) are absent from the model. Previous work has evaluated the effects that varying levels of macro skeletonization have on the performance of sensor network monitoring designs. However, research investigating the impact to sensor network design performance due to the lack of post service connection piping and system detail is lacking. This paper reports on the modeling of CWS sensor network designs for two real water systems. The first system is small and simple and the model has been artificially modified to include multi-story buildings. The second water system is actually dominated by multistory buildings but its base model does not contain any micro-level detail. Geographical information system (GIS) tools and site-specific information are used to construct and arrange reasonable representations of the high rise buildings into the model.

L\u2019effet du cycle de productivite, plus precoce aux Etats-Unis du fait d\u2019une reprise anterieure a celle de l\u2019Europe, explique ce ciseau. Le rebond du taux d\u2019investissement productif entame au debut de l\u2019annee 2003 aux Etats-Unis n\u2019est pas encore visible dans la zone euro. Cependant, meme aux Etats-Unis, les profits augmentent plus rapidement que l\u2019investissement. Les taux d\u2019autofinancement s\u2019ameliorent donc de part et d\u2019autre de l\u2019Atlantique, ce qui explique le moindre recours des SNF au financement externe. Les entreprises utilisent une part importante de leurs liquidites au desendettement, a la distribution de dividendes ou au rachat d\u2019actions. En contrepartie, la qualite de la dette des societes s\u2019est fortement amelioree, reduisant les primes de risque et encourageant l\u2019offre de credit bancaire a des couts de plus en plus faibles. Cette position attentiste des entreprises profite plus aux marches obligataires, rassures par la diminution des risques, qu\u2019aux marches d\u2019actions penalises en 2004 par la hausse des prix du petrole et le manque de projets d\u2019investissements. La sous-evaluation des cours boursiers europeens, au regard des profits degages par les entreprises, et l\u2019abondance de liquidites pourraient conduire a des operations de rachat et a une augmentation de la valorisation boursiere des marches. L\u2019augmentation de la capitalisation boursiere faciliterait alors la croissance de l\u2019investissement."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2004-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.6057386E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.580477E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0010657526", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "views", "@score": "1", "@datasource": "infrastruct_::f66f1bd369679b5b077dcdf006089556||OpenAIRE"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Influence of Clay Lens on Migration of Light Nonaqueous Phase Liquid in Unsaturated Zone"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "influence of clay lens on migration of light nonaqueous phase liquid in unsaturated zone"}], "abstract": {"$": "This study concerns the control of movement of light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) in unsaturated zone in the presence of relatively low permeability clay lens. A two-dimensional, finite-difference numerical model for the simultaneous movement of LNAPL and water through the unsaturated zone of the soil has been developed. The system is a three fluid phase system (water, LNAPL, and air) but in the derivation of the model, air was treated as an immobile phase at constant atmospheric pressure. The flow equations for LNAPL and water were cast in terms of the wetting and non-wetting fluid pressure heads, respectively. The finite-difference equations were solved implicitly with explicitly scheme using Newton-Raphson iteration with Taylor series expansion to treat nonlinearity. A physical model to represent the infiltration of kerosene above the clay lens was constructed. The numerical results were compared with those observed experimentally. The results of all tests showed that the presence of clay lens controls the vertical movement of LNAPL in heterogeneous porous medium."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2011-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.1725131E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.506987E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "6", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.7066495", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Extreme Pressures in Hydraulic\u2010Jump Stilling Basins"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "extreme pressures in hydraulic jump stilling basins"}], "abstract": {"$": "The hydraulic jump is a fascinating subject that has been the subject of several hundred technical papers.

Comparative simulations demonstrate the relative roles of the physical and chemical processes in determining solute transport. During the first 24 hours of the experiment, chloride concentrations were attenuated relative to expected plateau levels. Additional attenuation occurred for the sorbing cation strontium. The simulations account for these storage processes. Parameter values determined by calibration compare favorably with estimates from other studies in mountain streams.
