Such assignments would result in the ability to frame further new source-language sentences that could be paired with target-language sentences taken to have the same truth-conditions.

We compare empirical data from interviews with relatives of patients who have a severe brain injury with perspectives from mainstream bioethics scholars. We use the notion of an \"ethical landscape\" as an analogy for the different ethical positions subjects can take-whereby a person's position relative to the landscape makes a difference to the way they experience and interact with it. We show that, in comparison to studying abstract ethics \"from above\" the ethical landscape, which involves universal generalizations and global judgements, studying ethics empirically \"from the ground,\" within the ethical landscape foregrounds a more plural and differentiated picture. We argue it is important not to treat empirical ethics as secondary to abstract ethics, to treat on-the-ground perspectives as useful only insofar as they can inform ethics from above. Rather, empirical perspectives can illuminate the plural vantage points in ethical judgments, highlight the \"lived\" nature of ethical reasoning, and point to all ethical vantage points as being significant. This is of epistemic importance to normative ethics, since researchers who pay attention to the various positions in and trajectories through the ethical landscape are unlikely to think about ethics in terms of abstract agency-as can happen with top-down ethics-or to elide agency with the agency of policymakers.

In studies seven through nine, there is a repertoire of classical references to \"the good life,\" \"phronesis,\" and \"arete.\" Moreover, some have observed that since Ricoeur seems to subordinate his exegesis of Kant to his exegesis of Aristotle, we should read this work primarily \"as a contribution to neo-Aristotelian ethics.\"2 Even Ricoeur seems to intend as much since he subordinates the deontological viewpoint to the teleological perspective.3 As he points out himself, \"the plurality of virtues according to the Aristotelian and medieval tradition should not be dismissed merely for the sake of the respect of rule in the Kantian perspective.\"4 However, upon a closer reading, I will argue that Ricoeur's contribution to moral philosophy cannot be easily categorized as a contribution to a modern-day neo-Aristotelian ethics of virtue. My primary contention will be that what counts, ultimately, in Ricoeur's ethicomoral program is not virtue but attestation. The two should not be confused; attestation is not a virtue. I For the sake of contrast, let me preface my discussion of Ricoeur in light of one contemporary neo-Aristotelian agenda where virtues do count. In Alasdair MacIntyre's well-known work, After Virtue,5 virtues do count and they have \"the central place.\"6 At the very start, let me make a most obvious distinction in that Ricoeur is the consummate hermeneut while MacIntyre remains what I would call a proto-hermeneut. Let me explain. MacIntyre proposes a virtue-centered theory of ethics that is planted within the much larger present-day critique of ethical foundationalism and formalism. His program rejects assumptions about moral reason as a timeless source of insight into truth about justice and the good. The arguments in After virtue disparage concern for metaphysical assumptions that might underlie the form of the good, natural law, human nature, rational choice, as well as epistemological notions of certainty, self-evidence, and a priori necessity. Rather, MacIntyre forges what some have called a post-foundationalist conception of rationality where the very sense of \"'foundations' is superseded by a kind of socially-located, historical reconstruction.\"7 Hence, to pursue moral philosophy properly, MacIntyre argues for the necessity to see what is operating at various interlocking layers of social practice, social character, and historical circumstance. However, instead of elaborating the consequences to his historicist position, MacIntyre reasserts the necessity to establish morality on the basis of the classical concept of virtue. MacIntyre's attempts to make his version of virtue intelligible has evoked numerous criticisms that I will not repeat other than to emphasize the fact that, in the end, he never really tells us much about virtue.8 I will agree with the criticism that he does not provide a modern detailed conception of virtues, but merely argues for the possibility of doing so.9 This is amazing given the fact that close to one third of the book is devoted to a historical survey of virtues. What most critics have missed however is the tautological nature of his historicist approach to virtue. In every stage of the concept (practices, narrative unity of life, traditions), MacIntyre presupposes the existence and operative presence of virtue. As he himself is well aware, the very history of the practices he describes will have to be simultaneously a history of the virtues and the vices.' Is this saying any thing more than where there are practices of the type MacIntyre speaks of, certain virtues will be present, such that the presence of virtue will point to the way certain practices are performed? For example, in the first stage, we are told that \"a virtue is an acquired human quality the possession and exercise of which tends to enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to practices. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1998-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.1099743E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.306508E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.6103598", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The Emplotted Self: Self-Deception and Self-Knowledge"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the emplotted self self deception and self knowledge"}], "abstract": {"$": "The principal aim of this paper is to give a positive analysis of self-deception.

Gestatelings, on my view, are persons in both a legal and moral sense. Kingma challenges these claims. Specifically, Kingma argues that my previous argument is invalid, as it equivocates on the term \u2018newborn\u2019. Kingma concludes that questions about the legal and moral status of gestatelings remain \u2018unanswered\u2019. I am grateful to Kingma for raising potential concerns with the view I have presented. In this essay, however, I argue that (most) of Kingma\u2019s objections are unpersuasive. First, my original argument does not equivocate on terms like \u2018newborn\u2019 or \u2018neonate\u2019. The terms denote human beings that have been born recently; that is what matters to the argument. Charges of equivocation, I suspect, rest on a confusion between the denotation and connotations of \u2018newborn\u2019 (or \u2018neonate\u2019). Next, I show that, contra Kingma, it is clear that\u2014under current law in the USA and UK\u2014gestatelings would count as legal persons. Moral personhood is more difficult. On that subject, Kingma\u2019s criticisms have merit. In response, however, I show that my original claim\u2014that gestatelings should count as moral persons\u2014remains true on several (common) philosophical accounts of personhood. Regarding those accounts that imply gestatelings are not moral persons, I argue that advocates face a troubling dilemma.

By Eric Rebillard. (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. 2012, Pp. x, 134. $49.95. ISBN978-0-8014-5142-3.)We know we all have multiple identities. Eric Rebillard explores the possibility of looking at early Christians not as bounded, one-dimensional characters with a single defining identity, but as persons with normal fluid (and sometimes conflicting) identities in which their Christianity was only one of a plurality of identities. To explore this thesis, he selects as a sample the testimony of writers from North Africa ranging from the late-second to the early-fifth century-namely, Tertullian, St. Cyprian of Carthage, and St. Augustine.Some will be repelled by the sociological jargon that this exercise seems (unnecessarily) to entail-\"groupness,\" \"deactivate\" or \"activate,\" or \"give salience to Christianness,\" and so forth-and the analysis seems to work best in the period of Augustine, where we have fuller material and more ambiguously aligned social and religious figures and obligations. In the case of Tertullian, Rebillard is obliged to \"read against the grain\" (p. 6) and... to resist Tertullian's selective focus on Christianness. When he evokes everyday situations he consistently decontextualizes them in order to force on them his own agenda about what Christianness should entail. However, the numerous objections he feels compelled to refute show that his point of view was not shared, or at least not shared by all Christians. It would be naive to see \"real\" objections behind all the objections mentioned by Tertullian, but... Tertullian's rhetorical strategy could not be effective without somehow relating to his audience's experience, (p. 31)This leads Rebillard to be cautiously selective in Tertullian's testimony on Christians' behavior in their social context of the late-second and early-third century North Africa.The difficulty of this re-description of a Christian's individual behavior in neutral sociological terms is that it is just that: a re-description. It cannot legitimately lead to the deduction of an individual's subjective motivation. But that slippage is what Rebillard is inclined to make. A case from Cyprian is illustrative.It is clear that the majority of Christians in Carthage complied with orders of the Emperor Decius to offer sacrifice, or by bribery or other means obtained a certificate which certified that they had so offered sacrifice. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2013-10-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.8774865E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.734356E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.1296", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "\u00c9tica ambiental y Antropocentrismo d\u00e9bil"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "etica ambiental y antropocentrismo debil"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>La suposici\u00f3n de que una \u00e9tica ambiental adecuada debe ser no-antropoc\u00e9ntrica es err\u00f3nea.

Yet, it would seem strange to deny autonomy to every agent who regularly follows orders at work\u2014to do so would make autonomy a futile ideal. Most contemporary autonomy accounts provide purely theoretical analysis without reference to any practical goal that autonomy could serve. These accounts are likely to resolve this issue in one direction: either almost entirely including or excluding subservient workers from autonomy. Either solution would fail to distinguish agents who sufficiently control their lives, in spite of limited subservience, according to their own standards, from agents for whom subservience precludes a fulfilling life. I suggest the solution lies in a return to goal-oriented autonomy accounts, which can use the goal to distinguish when subservience overwhelms autonomy from when subservience and autonomy can coexist. I present an account that anchors autonomy in the happiness that it provides for agents who sufficiently control their lives as determined by their more important prudential standards.

While there are superficial similarities between both views and Kant's, I find more significant differences. Dummettian anti-realism, too, clearly differs from Kant's position: Kant believes in verification-transcendent reality, and transcendental idealism is not a theory of meaning or truth.

She was admitted to the hospital in the twenty-sixth or -seventh week of gestation and placed on intravenous medications (magnesium sulfate) to stop her preterm labor. Two days later, Ms. W asked her physician, Dr. C, to discontinue the medications because she was \"tired of being in the hospital and the medications and the fetus were too painful and uncomfortable.\" Dr. C explained that the potential risks of premature delivery include: respiratory immaturity, intraventricular hemorrhage, neurologic handicaps, and even fetal death. He advised her to continue the medications for two to three more weeks to give the fetus more time to mature. These critical weeks would enhance the fetus's chances of survival (from 50 percent at twenty-six weeks' gestation to 90 percent at thirty week's gestation) and decrease morbidity, reducing the risk of chronic lung disease (from 50 percent at twenty-six weeks to 20 percent at thirty weeks' gestation) and neurologic handicaps later on in life. Ms. W continued to refuse treatment, and a psychiatry consult was obtained. Ms. W was found to be extremely immature, emotionally labile and unrealistic, to have a very poor social situation (battered by family members), to have sometimes had suicidal ideas, to have used illegal drugs in the past (but not recently) and to have a longstanding personality disorder (histrionic personality). Meanwhile she continued to refuse the medication to stop labor and threatened to leave the hospital. Dr. C contemplates three options: Respect Ms. W's wishes and risk delivering a very premature fetus who may expire or may survive and be handicapped secondary to prematurity and its complications; refuse to abide by her wishes, but transfer care to a physician who is willing to do so; refuse to abide by her wishes and try to obtain a court order to force Ms. W to undergo treatment. What should Dr. C do? COMMENTARY Dr. C's first alternative emphasizes respect for patient autonomy, expressing the principle that competent adults have the right to refuse medical treatment. Ms. W has been diagnosed as having a \"personality disorder,\" but that does not make her incompetent. Nor does it seem that her doctor has serious doubts about Ms. W's competency to make decisions. Rather, Dr. C thinks that she is making a bad decision. However, respect for autonomy does not permit using psychiatric diagnoses to force patients to make good decisions. The third option is based on concern for the fetus. It balances the relatively minor inconvenience to Ms. W of staying in the hospital and continuing the medications against the extremely serious threat to the fetus of her refusal. A woman who chooses not to terminate a pregnancy has certain moral obligations to the child she has decided to bear. To be sure, she is not required to undergo serious risks to her own life and health, but no such risks are at stake here. These obligations make her refusal unjustified and unfair to the fetus who may die, or perhaps worse, survive and suffer neurologic damage in later life. Both options exert a pull on us, because both represent important moral principles. By contrast, the second possibility--transferring Ms. W to a physician who will abide by her wishes--seems a mere cop-out. It serves only to relieve Dr. C of responsibility for what happens. It does not address the underlying issue: should doctors resort to the courts to protect the unborn? In a recent column, alan Dershowitz claims that the law should protect fetuses-who-will-be-born from mothers who \"selfishly refuse to follow elementary precautions necessary to give their babies a fighting chance after birth...a mother who has assumed the responsibility of bringing a child into the world should be required to undertake certain minimum steps before birth to assure its health. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1989-03-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.104074E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.4241464E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.3264435E-7", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "THE BASING RELATION AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE DEBASING DEMON"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "The basing relation and the impossibility of the debasing demon"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>Descartes\u2019 demon is a deceiver: the demon makes things appear to you other than as they really are.

Perhaps, though, there is a more virulent demon in epistemic hell, one from which none of our knowledge is safe. Jonathan Schaffer (2010) thinks so.

However, he has never been afraid to change his mind. In the paper, \"Realism and Reason,\" the last part (Part Four) of Meaning and the Moral Sciences [16], he abandons the cause. Indeed, he now finds his former position \"incoherent\" ([16]: 124). He attributes the change in his views partly to new influences from Michael Dummett and Nelson Goodman, and to an old influence from W. V. Quine (pp. viii-ix). Aside from these influences he is led to anti-realism by a model-theoretic argument he propounds in \"Realism and Reason\" (pp.125-127) and in much greater detail in a recent paper. \"Models and Reality\" [18]. One aim of this study is to refute that argument. That is the concern of Part II. The issue of realism is not confined to Part Four of [16]: it recurs throughout, particularly in Part One. Until Part Four, Putnam's stance is pro-realist. To assess the bearing of any of Putnam's discussion on realism we need a clear idea of what realism is. Unfortunately, that is something that Putnam does not supply. On the contrary, Putnam casts almost impenetrable darkness on the question. The other aim of this study is to show this. That is the concern of Part I. The chief difficulty in understanding Putnam's discussion of realism is that it is thoroughly entangled with a discussion of truth. Truth is the other major concern of the book. Part One, the 1976John Locke lectures, comprising half the book, is largely devoted to arguing against Hartry Field [7] that we do not need to supplement a Tarskian theory of truth with theories of reference; indeed, Field's view that such theories are possible is \"a species of scientific utopianism\" (p. 58). And in Part Three, the paper \"Reference and Understanding,\" Putnam argues for a verificationist theory of understanding but for a correspondence notion of truth. (I have discussed these arguments about truth in [4].) Part Two, the paper \"Literature, Science, and Reflection,\" is the most sketchy part of the book.

Philosophy in the Library: A Healthy Debate or a State of Confusion?Lately there seems to be considerable debate-or confusion, depending on how you understand it-as to what libraries are, what is the proper object of study for library science, and even whether or not library science is really scientific. Enter the philosophers, and who knew there were so many among us! Although Zwadlo (1997) cited a 1934 paper by Danton in which it was reported that only 1 to 5 percent of library publications have any philosophical discussion, the debate about philosophy for libraries renewed in the 1990s, and Danton would be astonished at the number of publications appearing since the year 2000. One of the most noticeable aspects of this renewed interest is a focus on epistemological and ontological issues, a focus that can be traced back to a series of papers published in Library Quarterly in the 1990s (see Radford [1992], Budd [1995], Zwadlo [1997] and Dick [1999]). That was largely an AngloAmerican academic debate (Dick writing in English from South Africa). The task I set myself in this paper was to look at the debate during the past decade, and especially to consider views from beyond the Anglo-American universe. I chose seven books to examine, looking at them in particular for the political and ethical dimensions of the discussion.2. The Library: A Radically Political InstitutionI shall begin with Serbian librarian Zeljko Vuckovic's 2003 monograph Javne biblioteke i javno znanje (which could be translated in English as Public libraries and public knowledge). Like the other authors discussed below, he focuses on epistemological issues; more than any of the others he is concerned with the potential of libraries for political life. The hypothesis the author wishes to explore is the following:Public libraries are the most open and most democratic form of the institutionalization and use of public knowledge. Hence their key role in designing and building a library information system and infrastructure and their strategic importance in economic and social development. Providing free, equal and unrestricted access to the achievements of culture and civilization, to knowledge, ideas and information, the public library contributes to the development of a democratic public and the quality of life in the community, and the practical realization of the concept of rational communication [Vuckovic, 2003, p. 7].Jesse Shera's social epistemology is a guiding theoretical-methodological orientation in the first half of this work as the author proceeds through a discussion of terminology and chapters on the function of the library, public librarianship as a social institution, the development of the idea of public librarianship, and the legal foundations and history of public libraries in Serbia. The second half of the book looks at public librarianship in the context of international legal regimes, UNESCO declarations and IFLA, the public library as part of postmodern culture and the changes and challenges of public libraries in the information society with its digital libraries. A short chapter on the development of technical information systems for public libraries in Serbia is then followed by an even shorter chapter on the philosophical and axiological principles of public librarianship. It is those few final pages that are chiefly of interest to me, since the discussion within the book assumes these principles rather than argues them.The final chapter begins with the question \"Why philosophical considerations in an area that is primarily practical and pragmatic, in a service- and client-oriented activity?\" (p. 174). It is a question that nearly every one of the authors discussed below asks. The answer, he suggests, depends on the definition of philosophical inquiry but even more importantly on whether one thinks that librarianship needs a systematic theoretical foundation. In the author's view, systematic theory \"is an indication and measure of professional responsibility . \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2013-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.8564067E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "7.685133E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.010077696", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Bultmann in Retrospect"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "bultmann in retrospect1"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p> This article reviews a large and stimulating monograph on Bultmann (Congdon 2015a), an impressive collection of articles on his Theology of the New Testament (Longenecker and Parsons 2014) and a valuable German resource for studying his oeuvre (Landmesser 2017).

For Hume appears to entangle himself in two separate contradictions. First, Hume seems to claim both that true judges should not enter into vicious sentiments and that true judges should adopt the standpoint of an artwork's intended audience. But The Iliad, say, was obviously intended for an audience that shared Homer's flawed moral outlook.

G. Vlastos and M. Nussbaum do not share such anopinion. The former contends that Plato\u2019s view of love is about lovingonly a person\u2019s beauty, but not the entire person; thus, it falls short of anappropriate explanation of love. The latter holds that a theory of love should be complete, and that Plato\u2019s one is incomplete on the grounds that it does not account for personal love. These criticisms will be re-evaluated in light of the duality of love (the white and non-white horses\u2014in Phaedrus) as well as participants\u2019 views in the Symposium; a re-assessment will weaken the mentioned objections. This paper contends that from the Symposium and Phaedrus, one can have a fruitful understanding of being in love, being out of love, falling inlove, loving for its own sake and being erotically in love. In order to account for these related issues of love it is important to consider Plato\u2019s works in terms of his \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cunofficial\u201d views. The former is construed as the doctrine of the lover or loving for its own sake: this is associates with Diotima\u2019s views which are repeated by Socrates. With reference to the latter, it is possible to explain what personal love or being in love, being out of love, falling in love, and being erotically in love involve. Erotic love will be interpreted as an extension of our philosophical conception of love, related to views of love that are mentioned in the Symposium other than Socrates\u2019 report of Diotima\u2019s conceptions. This paper is divided into two parts: the first one will show views of love in the Symposium. That is, being in love, being out of love, falling in love and loving for its own sake will be discussed.

Rather than \u2018demythologizing\u2019 the demonology of his apocalyptic heritage, Paul saw a continuum between pure abstractions (\u2018height and depth\u2019, Rom. 8.38), personifiable abstractions (\u2018principalities and powers\u2019), literary personifications (\u2018Law, Sin and Death\u2019) and \u2018actual\u2019 personal spiritual beings. Such a view has its roots in Greek thinking going back as far as the fifth century BCE, and still current in the popular Platonism of the first and early second centuries. In his understanding of \u2018principalities and powers\u2019, Paul is working creatively between the angelology and demonology of his Jewish heritage, and the world-view of the thoughtful Graeco-Roman philosophical amateur. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2002-03-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.8609666E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.154909E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "6.0935974E-5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Could Morality Have a Source?"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "could morality have a source"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>It is a common idea that morality, or moral truths, if there are any, must have some sort of source, or grounding.

The author focuses on the phenomenon of the return of metaphysics to the philosophy of our time. This phenomenon is proposed to be analyzed from the viewpoint of historical ontology, which deals with the ontological presuppositions of knowledge and their historical dynamics. In the first part, the author highlights two directions of the historical development of metaphysical problems, one of which expresses the immediate metaphysical position, and the other represents the criticism of this position. The author associates criticism of metaphysics with the development of science and the philosophy of science. The author shows the difference between the \u201canalytical\u201d and \u201ccontinental\u201d approaches to metaphysical problems. The consideration of metaphysics as a historical phenomenon is associated with Hegel\u2019s metaphilosophical historicism. The alternative, non-historical, consideration of metaphysics is placed in the context of empiricism and positivism. The concepts of scientific realism are defined as a kind of positivistically restricted analytical metaphysics. The author highlights three points of growth of post-positivist philosophy and pays special attention to the relationship between post-positivist philosophy of science, history of science, metaphilosophical history of ideas, and sociology of science. The author traces the gradual formation of theoretical conditions for the rehabilitation of metaphysics in these research fields. The author demonstrates that the historicization of Kant\u2019s \u201ctranscendental subject\u201d creates a specific epistemological perspective that joins historicism with contextualism. Within this perspective, the question of the ontological presuppositions of empirical (primarily scientific) knowledge, their development and change becomes of great importance.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.155773E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "THE PECULIARITY OF THE VALUE ORIENTATIONS OF MODERN PRESCHOOLERS"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the peculiarity of the value orientations of modern preschoolers"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>The article deals with the problem of value orientations of modern preschoolers.

First, the major developments in Winch's thinking between his first published article on political authority (in a symposium with Richard Peters) and his later writings on the subject are identified and assessed. Criticism is focused mainly on his tendency to be insufficiently attentive to the distinction between being in authority and being an authority, and the implications this has for the distinctiveness of political authority. Secondly, particular attention is given to some of the key strands in Winch's analysis. These include his distinction between the nature and the grounds of political authority, how the role of consent is to be understood in the light of this distinction, how an adequate understanding political authority does not undermine our ideas of autonomy, and what it might mean to reject the whole idea of political authority. Finally, the article concludes by briefly defending the value of Winch's approach to political philosophy. Earlier it is shown that Winch's analysis does not foreclose on a range of political responses to authority, and this point is generalised to argue for a philosophical approach (like Winch\u2019s) that aims at understanding, rather than at advancing any particular set of moral or political principles."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2005-07-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.5834122E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.2518154E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.64893436", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Kant's Theses on Existence\u2217"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "kant s theses on existence"}], "abstract": {"$": "Kant's alleged refutation of the ontological proof for the existence of God has long been and still is being discussed by philosophers from various traditions with various motives.

The name is composed using the numerological system of Gematria in accordance with the alphanumeric code of M.-Hebr. misp\u0101r he\u1e35\u01ddra\u1e96i combining it with the AvGag alphabetic sequences (i.e., partly replacing each letter with the next one): Ishm\u01ddrai S\u0101b\u0101 b\u0113n \u0100\u1e0f\u0101m, i.e., Ishmerai Saba, Adam\u2019s son. The surname M.-Hebr. S\u0101b\u0101 (\u201can old man; a man with grey hair\u201d) is a synonym to the G. Graumann \u201cditto\u201d and Gr. \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u201cditto.\u201d These surnames indicate the author of The Yotvingian Book \u2013 Johannes Poliander, or Johann Graumann. He was a German pastor, theologian, teacher, humanist, reformer, and Lutheran leader.Based on the results of the analysis (cf. the list of theonyms of The Yotvingian Book which presupposes a reconstruction of the demonological order of the mythonyms), it is possible to make the statement that The Yotvingian Book should not be regarded as a material of the Episcopal inspection (therefore, it should not be related with Agenda Ecclesiastica or its authors) or an odd fragment of a more extensive source written adhering to the stylistics of the Renaissance, but as an example of a juristic document. Therefore, it cannot be characterized as an authentic source of the religious practices and beliefs of Western Balts.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-07-09"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.6261971E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Stand Where You Stand on Omelas"}, {"@classid": "subtitle", "@classname": "subtitle", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "An Activity for Teaching Ethics with Science Fiction"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "stand where you stand on omelas an activity for teaching ethics with science fiction"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>Science fiction is gaining academic recognition as a tool for teaching ethics and engaging potentially resistant students in communication and critical thinking, but there are not many lesson plans available for how to implement science fiction in the classroom.

PALAVRAS \u2013 CHAVE \u2013 Teorias de rastreamento. Nozick. Dretske. Conhecimento.  ABSTRACT  Tracking theories of knowledge maintain that knowledge is a real relation between cognitive agent and environment. Cognitive states of a knower track the truth of known propositions by basing belief on reliable indicators of truth (evidence, reasons, or belief forming methods). The novelty of this approach is that it places little emphasis on epistemic justification of a kind that aims at guiding epistemic agents by giving doxastic decision procedures or rules of epistemic responsibility. This paper gives some of the history of tracking theories, and then defends them against many of the objections most often judged (mistakenly) to refute tracking theories.

They can be understood in the context of effects of the global economy on human life and values, due its social imbalances and inequalities. The foremost guiding idea of ethical cosmopolitanism maintains that all humans must be considered to be equal. However, this postulate is questioned in the globalization era.Forced migration is the first challenge to the justification of cosmopolitan-ism nowadays. It spells out the global displacement of people caused by poverty and war danger. Today the economic and political elite in the world ignores its obligation to treat equally victims of forced migration, and is inclined to treat multiculturalism as useless. The growth of forced migration witnessed at present is caused by the existing deepening of inequalities and global injustice.Another challenge is the moral criticism of global capitalism starting from the point of view of the existence of alternative globalism. Many organizations of the global civic society have established international cooperation in their collective actions for the development of a socially-responsible globalization.Third challenge in this context are the abuses of cosmopolitanism in its justification of the so-called \u201chumanitarian interventions\u201d of the international community in shouldering the responsibility for mankind's development and securing human rights. Cosmopolitanism could thus be used as an ideology by the richest elites to justify their worldwide expansionism. The idea that the international community is interested in the preservation of human rights when they are violated by a \u201cdictatorial state\u201d is being forwarded.

In celebrating Holy Communion, people are engaging in a ritual that involves interaction with a variety of symbols. The methodological insights of Browning (1996) that described the lapse of a research activity ranging from description, to systemizing (exploring practical wisdom and understanding), to strategizing (practicing strategic practical theology) will be adhered to. The research problem for this research could be formulated in the following manner, namely: \u201cCould the cognizance of the lenses of cognition and recognition of the deeper message of Holy Communion enrich the conscious appropriation of salvation while celebrating the sacrament of Holy Communion?\u201d The research problem is addressed from the vantage-point of understanding sacraments from a Reformed paradigm. The concepts of cognition and recognition are highlighted from a brief historical description of what is a sacrament and also taking into account the insights from social psychology regarding the essence of the concepts of cognition and recognition. The article further elaborates on the functioning of the concepts of cognition (phronesis) and recognition (anamnesis). In the last section, the article utilizes a hermeneutical interaction between descriptive and systemizing perspectives in order to formulate strategizing perspectives on how a problematic praxis could possibly be addressed regarding people\u2019s experiences on participation in Holy Communion through the meaningful lenses of cognition and recognition. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-03-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.6261971E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "De 'missing link' tussen theorie en praktijk.

The purpose of the study is to identify the epistemological difficulties in constructing integral concepts of legal understanding, suggest solutions for them, and justify the option of integrative understanding of law based on a combination of dialectical and need-based methodological approaches. Main research methods. Based on dialectical logic, the essence of integrative legal understanding is covered as an attempt to synthesise contradictory approaches to understanding law, the process of integrating legal understanding is interpreted as removing contradictions in the development of legal phenomena, and integration appears as including individual moments of such development in the dynamic integrity. Based on the need-based approach, the study justifies the criterion for understanding certain phenomena as legal. Importance of the present study. It is proved that the integration of different legal understanding is a task that can be performed based on dialectical rather than formal logic, meanwhile preserving differences and contradictions between the combined conceptual elements. The study proves that during upon satisfying the needs, the properties of certain phenomena are integrated into human existence, acquiring the status of vital, and therefore normatively significant components of such existence.

It assures us of our shared objective world by transforming subjective points of view into intersubjectively binding agreements. Though it takes a very broad approach epistemologically, this conception of science may yet be too narrow in respect to notions of objectivity. It excludes a prominent mode of knowledge production that might be called technoscientific. This exclusion becomes particularly evident in Friedman\u2019s discussion of Heidegger as a critic of Cassirer and Carnap and as a critic of objectivity as \u201cuniversal validity\u201d of scientific propositions. If one tends to Heidegger\u2019s own account of objectivity, one encounters a non-propositional notion of truth. Science is seen as a technology that brings forth phenomena and processes. Accordingly, even where modern physics appears to be concerned primarily with the formulation of theories and the testing of hypotheses, it uses mathematical and representational techniques to conceive and create the modern world. And more powerfully than intersubjective agreement, technologies assure us of the unity and objectivity of our simultaneously social as well as natural world. There may be good reasons to hold fast to the close affiliation of communicative rationality, science, and enlightenment. However, to the extent that it turns a blind eye to technoscientific knowledge production and the technological character of science, a philosophy of technoscience needs to develop an alternative perspective on questions of objectivity, explanation, inference, or validation."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2012-03-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9855693E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.6108709E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "4", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.2280933", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A Paradox Out of Context: Harris and Holm on the Precautionary  Principle"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "A paradox out of context: Harris and Holm on the precautionary principle."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a paradox out of context harris and holm on the precautionary principle"}], "abstract": {"$": "The precautionary principle is frequently referred to in various momentous decisions affecting human health and the environment.

Even if parents have moral reasons to choose the child with the best expected life, they may not be under any obligation to do so."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2014-02-12"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.3976286E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "3.8803503E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.6644588", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "downloads", "@score": "101", "@datasource": "opendoar____::01386bd6d8e091c2ab4c7c7de644d37b||e-Prints Soton"}, {"@id": "views", "@score": "1", "@datasource": "opendoar____::01386bd6d8e091c2ab4c7c7de644d37b||e-Prints Soton"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The Johannine Son of Man: A New Proposal"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the johannine son of man a new proposal"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>How is the association of the descent/ascent motif with the Johannine Son of Man to be explained if the gnosticism theory no longer holds? \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd (3.13) is usually taken to refer to Jesus' final ascension.

The ambiguity centers on the notion of \u201creasonableness\u201d as it applies to comprehensive doctrines and to persons. As Nussbaum observes, the notion of reasonableness in political liberalism can be construed in a purely ethical sense or in a sense that combines ethical and epistemic elements. The ambiguity bears crucially on the respect for persons norm\u2014a key norm that helps to distinguish political from perfectionist versions of liberalism. Nussbaum contends that when political liberals affirm a construal of reasonableness that includes epistemic elements they run into trouble in formulating an account of their view that sharply distinguishes it from perfectionist liberalism. She contends further that perfectionist versions of liberalism should be rejected since they fail to offer an account of respect for persons. This paper responds to Nussbaum\u2019s challenge. It argues that an adequate account of respect for persons must make reference to epistemic elements. This being the case not only explains why political liberals were correct to incorporate epistemic elements into their accounts of reasonableness but also why it is a mistake to think that perfectionist liberals themselves cannot present an appealing account of respect for persons.

Specifically it raises the question whether the possibility to construct logical languages in calculus form justifies the expectation that for a natural language it should be possible to construct a fixed system of categories and rules that allows to produce all and only the meaningful sentences of that language. Drawing on ideas that Wittgenstein had developed in his criticism of Frege, this question is answered negatively: It is impossible to formulate such a complete list because the relevant semantic categories are not given in advance, in a realm outside language. Instead, they are created by linguistic activity and are projected into ever new fields of application, changing their semantic value in these projective steps. So speakers on the one hand rely on fixed linguistic structures they only \u2018re-create\u2019 (traditional grammar); on the other hand they use these structures creatively in ways that cannot be anticipated and spelled out exhaustively.

The author reveals the specifics of this concept in modern moral philosophy, identifies the place of the concept of virtue in the system of other moral concepts, such as law, duty, obligation, etc., by means of which the modern conceptions of morality has been constructed. The analysis of contemporary research and the works of modern moral philosophers shows that the main change in the concept of virtue is that it is no longer considered as the main concept around which the conceptions of morality are elaborated. The concept of virtue is most often used as an auxiliary concept to express the consistency and determination of a person (his will) in the fulfilment of the prescriptions of the moral law or considered as a result of the consistent fulfilment of moral duty. In terms of moral content, virtue in most modern moral-philosophical conceptions was associated with love, or benevolence. Love, or benevolence, opposes the sphere of justice, which, unlike the sphere of virtue, is regulated by precisely formulated laws and rules. Both spheres are recognized as extremely important: justice as a sphere of laws and rules ensures the survival of society, and love and benevolence as a sphere of virtue promote the maintenance of proper human relations and improve the quality of public life. Besides that, the doctrines constituted around the concept of virtue emphasize that the inner character of moral motivation is a key feature of morality. The distinction in the conceptions of morality between the spheres of laws, rules, on the one hand, and virtues, on the other hand, implies that the modern moral philosophers understood complexity and heterogeneity of the phenomenon of morality and supposed that a more complex conceptual apparatus is required to grasp it."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-12-20"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.6261971E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "CORNEA, Scepticism and Evil"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "cornea scepticism and evil"}], "abstract": {"$": "The Principle of Credulity: \u2018It is basic to human knowledge of the world that we believe things are as they seem to be in the absence of positive evidence to the contrary\u2019\u2018Swinburne 1996: 133].

In epistemology, Malebranche postulated an illuminating union between the mind of man and the divine Word, insisting on an absolutely direct involvement of the Second Person in all human cognition, both intellectual and sensible.

The inquiry about rationality and justification of religious beliefs has shaped Western philosophy of religion. However, the scope of philosophy of religion in the Western context has been widened since Hume and Kant. When the West began to be exposed to non\u2010Western religions, philosophical reflection on non\u2010Western religions is also brought into the scope of philosophy of Religion.

When we look at philosophy of religion in a broad sense, the field of Chinese philosophy of religion begins to emerge. In this survey paper, I will focus on several issues which, in a broad sense of philosophy of religion, can be construed as the issues of Chinese philosophy of religion. One of the issues is about the religiosity of Confucianism. The second issue is about the concept of Tian. The third is the issue regarding the origin and nature of Chinese state religion and its characteristics which also have caught the attention of scholars, especially, in China. Is Confucianism a religion? How should we construe the religiosity of Confucianism if it does have a religious dimension? Is Tian a theological term? How does Tian differ from Western God? Is the sacrifice to Tian religious and a form of monotheism? What is the nature of state religion in traditional China?

While medical ethicists will continue to grapple with the issues posed by the unrelenting problems of treating AIDS and cancer patients, new developments in genetics, neurobiology, and biotechnology will generate novel ethical questions. In genetics, the Human Genome Project will generate new data about the biological underpinnings of human attributes and proclivities to wellness and disease. Originally designed to uncover the DNA base sequence of the entire 100,000 or so genes embedded in human DNA, it has recently been scaled back to a mapping project including sequence analysis of nucleotide bases surrounding certain limited \"hot spots.\" Even in its scaled-down version, the genome project raises major issues of distributive justice. By its price alone (budgeted at $109 million for 1991-92), it threatens to displace equally worthy endeavors in basic research. A good discussion of this issue is found in a recent perspectives piece by Bernard D. Davis et al., \"The Human Genome and Other Initiatives,\" Science 249 (1990), 342-43. Once the data from the genome project begins to be assembled it will present distributive questions of its own. Which disorders are sufficiently serious and prevalent to deserve the earliest attention? Which genetic tests should be pressed into service in screening operations? What groups of persons--extended families, ethnic groups or lineages--deserve priority for investigation? Even these earliest findings will raise potential problems of privacy, confidentiality, and applicability; see \"Ethics and the New Genetics,\" Lancet 335 (1989), 1054-55. Insurers and health maintenance organizations may demand access to personally identifiable genetic information. When should data that indicate a modest probability of future disability or proclivity to disease (for example, susceptibility to infection with HIV) be used? What is the demarcation point of certainty that warrants use of linkage data to indicate readiness of a new gene probe for marketing? This last dilemma has confronted cystic fibrosis researchers intent on developing a diagnostic test, as reported by Leslie Roberts, \"CF Screening Delayed for Awhile, Perhaps Forever,\" Science 247 (1990), 1296-97, since the genetic mutations for cystic fibrosis have turned out to be much more complex than initially thought. To date, major insurers and underwriters have been reluctant to put genetic data into their testing requirements. Major employers are similarly hesitant about using susceptibility markers to screen workers in hazardous settings where toxic exposures may occur. This reluctance raises ethical questions of its own. If we can predict who is at high risk for heart disease, lung cancer, and bladder cancer from simple genetic tests, do we not have an obligation to make such tests widely available (assuming their high predictive value)? And what about the insurer's position that it has traditionally exercised the right to identify, exclude, or underwrite individuals commensurate to their risk status? These questions are examined in \"Insurance Costs and Genetic Testing,\" Lancet 335 (1990), 1331. The genome project will undoubtedly identify genetic data of potentially great diagnostic value. Within the confines of the doctor-patient relationship, it is unlikely that this information will pose major difficulties. However, genetic data almost always has relevance outside the domain of this relationship, implicating members of a kindred group as carriers, likewise affected, or at risk for similar disorders. Walther C. Zimmerli explores this in \"Who Has the Right to Know the Genetic Constitution of a Particular Person?\" Ciba Foundation Symposium 149 (1990), 93-102. How and when should such persons be notified of their possible risk status? Sometimes, as has proven to be true for the multiple genetic mutations that cause cystic fibrosis or neurofibromatosis, the genetic data make these issues even more complex. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1990-11-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9839602E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.402815E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.7751968E-8", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Tertullian and Rebekah: a Re-Reading of an \"Anti-Jewish\" Argument in Early Christian Literature"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Tertullian and Rebekah: A Re-Reading of an \"Anti-Jewish\" Argument in Early Christian Literature"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "tertullian and rebekah a re reading of an anti jewish argument in early christian literature"}], "abstract": {"$": "Rebecca, la femme d'Isaac et la mere d'Esau et de Jacob, est mentionnee a neuf reprises dans les ouvrages de Tertullien.

Both authors claim that a work of art is not only a material object but also a centre of practices, values, beliefs, traditions, memories, and so on. I argue that, insofar as a work of art can be the centre of this type of network in a museum, the description of art these authors propose defeats their own claims against museums. In the second part, I suggest that Heidegger's and Quatrem\u00e8re's descriptions of the role of art can be articulated with the help of Donald Davidson's understanding of the interconnection between the material world and human concepts. As Davidson sees it, things and people can only be described in relation to the other particular persons, objects, events and places they are connected to. From this perspective, the subjective, the objective and the intersubjective cannot be grasped independently.

We don\u2019t make such claims just for the sake of it, just for fun, or for no reason at all. So what is the real point or purpose of this epistemically evaluative aspect of our linguistic practice? It must have some utility, but what? What would we lose if epistemically evaluative words suddenly disappeared from our vocabulary?1 The question requires some motivation, since discovering a word\u2019s function doesn\u2019t necessarily call for armchair philosophy. Some words might \u2217I pronounce it, when speaking English, like this: sin \u00b7on dor \u00b7uh\u00b7mudge\u00b7uh. The question of this paper thus contrasts with the timeworn questions of how to give necessary and sufficient conditions for this or that philosophically interesting property. There are, however, a few excellent philosophical explorations of the function of this or that philosophically interesting word or concept. In philosophy of logic and language, Quine offered an elegantly simple insight about the utility of the truth predicate which precipitated the contemporary development of deflationism about truth; see Quine (1970), Leeds (1978), Horwich (1990/98), and Field (1994). In metaphysics, a series of recent papers on modality have broached the fascinating issue of the function of modal concepts; see Kment (2006), chapter 5 of Williamson (2007), and Divers (2010). In epistemology, there is Edward Craig\u2019s wonderful and underappreciated book, Knowledge and the State of Nature, Craig (1990). Some recent work by Steven Reynolds, brought to my attention only after this paper was given at the Rutgers Epistemology Conference, is closely related to Craig\u2019s project; see Reynolds (2002). Though Craig and Reynolds write about knowledge rather than rationality or justification, there are obvious common themes and specific points of contact between their views and the view I will be developing. The most notable common theme is the general importance we assign to the role of testimony in the function epistemic language. One major difference, since they write about knowledge and not rationality, is that their views are not designed to explain the puzzle I will be raising shortly."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2012-02-03"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "6.307498E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.0752571E-8", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "50", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "9.750379", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "8", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Negativity, Finitude, and the Leap in Heidegger's<i>Contributions to Philosophy</i>"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "negativity finitude and the leap in heidegger s contributions to philosophy"}], "abstract": {"$": "ABSTRACTThis article examines Heidegger's assessment of negativity and finitude in the late 1930s and his enlargement of these issues in the name of a leap from one type of philosophy, one type of beginning, to a wholly other beginning.

A basic conviction is that the triune God is also the solitary God of the Old Testament. The problem that emanated from this conviction is how to relate the triune God with the one God of the Old Testament. It is argued that New Testament authors made use of Old Testament metaphors to conceptualise God as the triune God. The central question mentioned in this article may be formulated as follows: how do the Old Testament metaphors of God as Father, the Son of God and Holy Spirit contribute to a better understanding of the God that we confess to be the triune God? The revealing of God\u2019s proper name in Exodus 3 and the meaning of Jesus\u2019 name in Matthew 1 create a relationship between Jesus and God. The theological link between the name of God in the Old Testament and the name of Jesus in the New Testament functions as a firm indicator that God and Jesus are two persons in the Trinity. It is also argued that due cognisance should be taken of the fact that the Old Testament is also the Tanakh of Judaism. It is for this reason better to speak about the Trinity and the Old Testament rather than the Trinity in the Old Testament, as this would imply that the Christian concept of a triune God is read back into the Old Testament. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: These results serve as a challenge to the important and often neglected interdisciplinary debate between systematic theology and the study of the Old Testament.

This epistemic-soteriological theory speaks to common speculative questions about language and the world, offering a new way of understanding how human beings can come to know the world as-it-is, and as-it-should-be; a way that is philosophical, yet based firmly in Medieval Jewish theology."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2015-05-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.624046E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the imaginary museum of musical works an essay in the philosophy of music"}], "abstract": {"$": "What is involved in the composition, performance, and reception of classical music? What are we doing when we listen to this music seriously? Why when playing a Beethoven sonata do performers begin with the first note indicated in the score; why don't they feel free to improvise around the sonata's central theme? Why, finally, does it go against tradition for an audience at a concert of classical music to tap its feet? Bound up in these questions is the overriding question of what it means philosophically, musically and historically for musicians to speak about music in terms of 'works'. Lydia Goehr describes how the concept of a musical work emerged, as late as 1800, and subsequently defined the norms, expectations, and behavioural patterns that have come to characterize classical musical practice. The description is set in the context of a more general philosophical account of the rise and fall of concepts and ideals, and of their normative functions; at the same time, current debates amongst conductors, early-music performers, and avant-guardists are addressed.

It argues that it is important to appreciate the diversity of participation in contemporary international life, since a cogent and effective moral critique needs to recognise the range of relevant actors. However, the article does not assume that the goals of normative individualism have been largely achieved. To note that there appears to have been advances in both the practice and the law relating to the protection of human rights does not imply that the role of ethical critique is becoming redundant. There remains an important role for moral critique even in a changed, less state-dominated international landscape. Recent events at the international level have demonstrated \u2013 not only on the part of IGOs and INGOs, but also by a number of Western governments \u2013 an increasingly vigorous and sometimes belligerent moralism, evident for instance in a new popular vocabulary of `ethical foreign policy', `ethical investment', and the like. While an energetic protection of human rights is to be welcomed on moral grounds, there is still also an important role for ethical argument in assuring the rigour of such policies. In other words, in the future it may be the actions (even though `ethically' inspired) of non-State actors as much as governments which could be scrutinised through the filter of normative individualism."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2001-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.3701215E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "5.03204E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "15", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.010225761", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "On Sublimation: The Significance of Psychoanalysis for the Study of Religion"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "On sublimation: the significance of psychoanalysis for the study of religion"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "on sublimation the significance of psychoanalysis for the study of religion"}], "abstract": {"$": "L'A. propose de rehabiliter le discours religieux de la psychanalyse pour l'etude des religions, en etudiant la sublimation chez Freud et ses reinterpretations chez DiCenzo, Ricoeur et Deleuze."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2000-12-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9839602E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.95744E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "2.193695E-5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "INVESTIGATION OF THINGS, PHILOSOPHICAL COUNSELING, AND THE MISERY OF THE LAST MAN.1"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "investigation of things philosophical counseling and the misery of the last man 1"}], "abstract": {"$": "A travers un dialogue fictif entre un philosophe occidental et un certain visiteur sur l'enseignement du \u00abGrand apprentissage\u00bb confucianiste et la sagesse du dernier homme nietzscheen, l'A. etudie le processus de demystification propre a la technique du conseil philosophique, indiquant la voie de la culture de soi et de la tranformation de soi comme seule sortie possible hors du sentiment de l'arbitraire cree par la revolution de l'information"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2008-06-28"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.6355364E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Battling without Beards:  Synesius of Cyrene\u2019s Calvitii encomium, Arrian\u2019s Anabasis Alexandri  and the Alexander discourse of the fourth century AD"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Battling without Beards : Synesius of Cyrene's Calvitii encomium, Arrian's Anabasis Alexandri and the Alexander discourse of the fourth century AD"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Battling without Beards: Synesius of Cyrene\u2019s Calvitii encomium, Arrian\u2019s Anabasis Alexandri and the Alexander discourse of the fourth century AD"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>This paper explores the literary tradition of the curious chreia that Alexander ordered his men to shave off their beards before battle.

In <jats:italic>Stream of Consciousness</jats:italic> (2000) I found Sprigge's case for phenomenal holism problematic on several counts; in this paper I re-assess some of these criticisms. Recent experimental work suggests cross-modal perceptual interference may be far more prevalent than expected. I argue that although these results do lend support to phenomenal holism in one of its guises, they do not support the strong form of holism espoused by Sprigge. I then move on to consider the relevance and impact of certain gestalt-related considerations, and argue that these considerations at best establish that the stronger form of holism applies to some parts of some experiential states, but not to all parts of all states, as Sprigge claims. I then consider a more promising way forward for anyone who wishes to defend an across-the-board holism of the strong variety, arguing that what is required is a form of phenomenal interdependence that is rooted solely in phenomenal unity.

For instance, some shots and sequences depict the perceptual field of a particular character. Others depict a character's visual imaginings, memories, dreams, or hallucinations. Still others render in visual terms the content of something that some character is verbally reporting or describing. This short list of possibilities is obviously not exhaustive, and the individual \"subjective\" modes deserve lengthier discussion. Nevertheless, let us say that (1) and (2) give us, as a crude first approximation, a specification of the norm of \"the transparency of narration\" in classical narrative film. Although the conception that these conditions jointly express has a recognizable intuitive import, it is not easy to elaborate the conception more sharply. The concept of an objective shot or sequence in fiction films is problematic and, correlatively, so are the various concepts of subjective depiction. Moreover, the nature and functioning of the factors that contextually mark the epistemic status of a movie segment (that is, a shot or edited sequence) can be surprisingly elusive. These are among the issues I will address in this essay. However, my investigation is not simply motivated by an untrammeled analytic impulse. I have been struck by the fact that there are a number of fairly recent mainstream, commercial films-films that present an elaborate, detailed, and more or less coherent narrativethat depend on surprising, systematic violations of narrational transparency. The narration in the films I have in mind is significantly unreliable in particular ways, and its unreliability depends precisely on the audience's confounded expectation that the norm of narrational transparency will have been in place. These movies have come to be known as \"twist movies,\" where the \"twist\" in question is predominately epistemological. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Robert Wiene, 1919) is a celebrated early example of the strategy, and there have been scattered instances throughout the history of film. But lately we have enjoyed (or deplored) a positive explosion of epistemically twisted movies. The films I am thinking of come in at least two broad kinds. First, there are movies in which the cinematic narration, as the audience eventually comes to realize, represents the narrative action through the subjective perspective of a particular character, although, in general, that action has not been represented from the perceptual point of view of the character in question. That is, the narration stands outside the \"focalizing\" character, regularly presenting him or her within the frame. Still, at the same time, the narration reflects the problematic way in which the character imagines the relevant fictional history to have transpired. Jacob's Ladder (Adriane Lyne, 1990) is one example of this strategy, appearing early in the recent cycle.

There are some dozen examples in targums Onqelos and Jonathan, but to the best of my knowledge, the suffix is attested only once in Palmyrene and not at all in Nabatean or Hatran. The Judean Desert texts contain several additional examples of the suffix and, for this reason, provide important evidence for its history. The 2nd feminine singular suffix is represented orthographically in documents from the Judean Desert by 9:-, '\",-, I-, and 1J-.

The former is identified with how interpretation is typically understood in analytic philosophy of art, whereas the latter as belonging to continental literary theory, thus framing the discussion within the relevant debates that the two eminent philosophical schools engage in. Specifically, the article argues in favor of a number of claims. It discusses the notion of surface interpretation, understood as the informed practice involved in general attention to a literary work with an aim of attaining an aesthetically rewarding experience (appreciation). Surface interpretation locates a literary work in a specific art-historical context and at minimum acknowledges the author\u2019s categorial intentions pertinent to genre, general aims and representational content of the work. The article also argues against the notion that appreciation, which is supposed to be the main aim of surface interpretation, is purely perceptual (Carroll, Lamarque) and that consequently aesthetic experience does not involve affective experiences. Grounding appreciation in affective experiences (Levinson) leads me to acknowledge an important continuity between fully formed aesthetic experience and more instinctive or \u00bbeffortless\u00ab ways of attending to a work, such as when one \u00bbjust enjoys\u00ab the emotions afforded by, say, a horror story rather than with full aesthetic attention to the work, where the affective component dominates, but which are less structured to be properly called aesthetic within the conceptual framework I offer here. As a result, I divide the pleasures of attending to an artwork into the instinctive, hedonic ones and the properly aesthetic ones, which both constitute two basic modes of reading. The aesthetic mode is not fully separate from the hedonic one, but on the contrary, by tapping directly into the hardwired human cognitive-affective architecture, it provides a general framework and parameters for the emergence of the higher-order aesthetic mode where more prominence is given to art-historical knowledge and more attention to the design and form/content interrelation. Importantly, aesthetic mode does not operate with the absence of the hedonic one, though they can simultaneously produce different evaluations (e.\u200ag. hedonically positive, aesthetically/artistically negative). The two modes could be said to have distinct model readers with corresponding levels of competence. The hedonic reader, as opposed to the aesthetic one, would be largely oblivious to art-historical contexts and would be more selective in terms of attention to the work, relying on direct affect-triggering textual cues. Interpretive effort would be reduced, too. I also discuss my model with reference to the psycho-historical framework for the study of art appreciation as developed by Bullot and Reber which attempts to explain how art responders acquire more complex types of attention to the work, or stances, from mere exposure to the work\u2019s perceptual content to tracing causal history and integrating historical contexts into a more rounded approach to art appreciation. An important part of my argument is the indication that non-habitual pattern isolation responsible for identifying structures, interrelations between a work\u2019s elements and forming predictions about its development in the process of reading is a crucial component of aesthetic experience. Next, I move on to discuss deep interpretation, which typically is seen as miles apart from aesthetic interpretation. It is sometimes assumed that deep, semantic interpretation disregards surface interpretation, including authorial intentions and art-historical contexts and emphasizes reader\u2019s active, playful role in generating an unconstrained swirl of connotations. Such a practice is seen either as being a source of bliss (Barthes) or as a purely intellectual pursuit attempting at enhancing the understanding of the work (Sontag). I argue against all three views and integrate deep interpretation into the model sketched so far. Seeing deep interpretation as unconstrained and purposeless (Lamarque) is an uncharitable straw man. Such a vision would render semantic interpretation unintelligible and random, but this is not the case. By looking into some examples taken from Roland Barthes\u2019 own work which is one of the foundations of modern theory-driven interpretation, I argue that despite his bombastic claims, he is unable to start his deep interpretation project without acknowledging categorial intentions and art-historical context of the work\u2019s creation. Consequently, and comparing his views to contemporary debates on work, authorship, intentions and aesthetics, his work is an attack on a rather dated understanding of these concepts. Theory-driven interpretation can be flawed or stretched, if it does not pay its dues to surface interpretation. Next, I argue that both surface and deep interpretation operate according to the principles of value-maximization (Davies) which can override author\u2019s intentions about the details of her work\u2019s meaning. Using a specific theoretical framework in deep interpretation is an extension of the non-habitual patterns isolation principle and serves to enhance the experience of the work by trying to recognize more pattern that add up to the work\u2019s complexity while remaining faithful to the work\u2019s basic contents. Taking up the semantic reading stance already entails taking up the underlying aesthetic and, more distantly, hedonic stances. In the end, theory-driven interpretation forms the third reading mode which emerges with a correspondingly more competent model reader from the partly-constraining aesthetic mode.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2020-02-28"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.0803076E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.7868967E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.416", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "3", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A Rest from Reason: Wittgenstein, Drury, and the Difference Between Madness and Religion"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a rest from reason wittgenstein drury and the difference between madness and religion"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Faced with troubling professional decisions in his long and successful career as a psychiatrist, M.

If to sentences, then certainly not to type sentences, such as \u2018I am going to London tomorrow\u2019, but only to token sentences, that is, sentences considered as uttered by a particular speaker at a particular time. It would, however, be inconvenient to restrict truth to utterances that are actually made; we may therefore adopt the device and terminology of Davidson, and speak of a \u2018<jats:italic>statement</jats:italic>\u2019 constituted by a triple [<jats:italic>s</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>] of a type sentence <jats:italic>s</jats:italic>, an individual <jats:italic>i</jats:italic> and a time <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>, the existence of which does not depend on whether <jats:italic>i</jats:italic> in fact uttered <jats:italic>s</jats:italic> at <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>.

The orthodox quasi-realist strategy (famously developed by Simon Blackburn) is to understand these in terms of the agent\u2019s worrying that some improving change would lead one to aban-don the relevant moral belief. However, it is unclear whether this strate-gy generalizes to cases in which the agent takes their error to be funda-mental in a sense articulated by Andy Egan.

Egan suggests that Blackburn\u2019s approach is the only game in town for the quasi-realist when it comes to making sense of judgment of fallibility, and therefore concludes that Blackburn\u2019s ina-bility to handle worries about fundamental moral error refutes quasi-realism tout court.

In The Psychology of Moral Development, the second of three massive volumes setting out his ideas in philosophy, psychology, and moral education, the remarkable scope of Kohlberg's endeavor will be apparent to any reader. The essays collected here, of which most are very recent and written with associates, express a diversity of concerns with no loss of thematic unity. There are occasional lapses in coherence and consistency, but this is perhaps only to be expected in a system viewed as open to revision. The volume offers a comprehensive discussion of a wide range of topics and issues. It includes a current statement of Kohlberg's position and an elaborate response to published criticism. There is a detailed treatment of the relationship between moral judgment and moral action. The cultural universality of moral stages is hypothesized by reference to longitudinal studies undertaken in Turkey and Israel. And in addition to explicit discussions of the measurement of moral judgment, there are numerous illustrations of stage assessments, which should prove instructive to those unfamiliar with Kohlberg's revised scoring system. The Psychology of Moral Development accounts many modifications of Kohlberg's theory of moral development, of which three deserve special notice. As typically elaborated, Kohlberg's theory involves the specification of six stages of moral judgment associated with three levels; the preconventional (Stages 1 and 2), the conventional (Stages 3 and 4), and the postconventional or \"principled\" (Stages 5 and 6).

The practice increases the chances of a live birth, but also raises the likelihood of multiple births, with their risks and costs. It is time for the United States to enact policy that will limit the number of embryos transferred to a woman. Health Problems In vitro fertilization in the United States often leads to multiple births. More than 30 percent of deliveries using fresh embryos and nearly 25 percent of those using frozen ones result in multiple births, (1) with 48 percent of all IVF infants born in multiple births. (2) Any multiple birth raises health risks. Among twins, more than 60 percent are born prematurely; among triplets or other multiples, more than 95 percent are premature. (3) Primarily for this reason, IVF twins, triplets, and other multiples are more likely than singletons to require neonatal intensive care, to develop cognitive and physical disabilities, and to die. Twins have an infant mortality rate four to five times that of singletons; triplets have an eight- to tenfold increase. (4) These infants are also at increased risk for cerebral palsy, deafness, and blindness, and they exhibit delayed language development and lower verbal intelligence. (5) Multiple births pose greater health risks for the mother as well. They increase the risk for maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, hemorrhage, Cesarean section, and death, as well as for postpartum depression and high parenting stress. (6) These risks drive up the cost of health care. In one study, the delivery-associated hospital costs were twice as high per child for twins as for singletons, and four times higher for triplets. (7) Lifetime medical costs may be two hundred times higher. (8) IVF patients might be willing to assume the increased risks of multiple births in order to increase their likelihood of having at least one child. Studies indicate, however, that the success rate improves only marginally with multiple transfers, and some studies have found no difference. In one study involving women younger than age thirty-six with good-quality embryos, double-embryo transfers increased the live birth rate from 39 to 43 percent, but the multiple birth rate increased from 1 to 33 percent. (9) In another study of women with good prospects for successful IVF, those with single-embryo transfers had the higher live birth rate--41 percent versus 36 percent for the double-embryo transfers. Moreover, the multiple birth rate rose from zero for single-embryo transfers to 37 percent for double-embryo transfers. (10) For women who have less favorable prospects, on the other hand, a double-embryo transfer may significantly increase the chances of success. In one study, it doubled the pregnancy rate. (11) To be sure, there are other tradeoffs between single- and double-embryo transfers. To achieve a comparable overall live birth rate, women using single-embryo transfers may need to undergo two IVF cycles instead of one, doubling their cost of treatment. And older women who want two children may prefer to have twins rather than successive singletons. Because of the decline in fertility with advancing age, a forty-year-old woman may not be able to become pregnant a second time. (12) The Response Professional guidelines discourage multiple-embryo transfers, especially for women under age thirty-five. Suleman's physician transferred six embryos for her pregnancy, but Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines indicate that she should have received only one or two. Yet IVF procedures with two or more embryos are still common. Nearly 90 percent of embryo transfers involve at least two embryos, and more than 40 percent involve at least three. (13) To be sure, the percentage of IVF procedures with more than two embryos has recently declined, but the shift has been to double- rather than single-embryo transfers. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2010-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.5705903E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.462805E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "6", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.08166619", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Rituals of knowing: rejection and relation in disability theology and Meister Eckhart"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "rituals of knowing rejection and relation in disability theology and meister eckhart"}], "abstract": {"$": "One of the most powerful claims of disability theology is that the rejection of persons with disabilities somehow correlates with a rejection of God.

Here the correlative rejection is exposed as an inevitable result of the narrow emphasis on autonomy and rationality in human self-perception which shape the habituated, even ritualised ways that we try to know persons with intellectual disabilities and God. By contrast, truly knowing and relating to persons with intellectual disabilities, God, and finally also ourselves, relies on a reconciliation with the dependence, vulnerability, and non-rational forms of exchange that a narrow attachment to autonomy and rationality seems directly to occlude. The correlative rejection thus signals both a practical and epistemological problem which results from how we view ourselves and how we subsequently relate to and try to know others, the harmful effects of which are both ethical and spiritual."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2017-11-29"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9449991E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.2785512E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.07776", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Nevada Physician Workforce Shortage and the Inefficient Retention of Nevada Medical School Graduates"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "nevada physician workforce shortage and the inefficient retention of nevada medical school graduates"}], "abstract": {"$": "Nevada has a steadily growing population, but the rise in population does not have a sufficient growth in physicians to sustain the population\u2019s healthcare.

This paper aims to shed light on them. It argues that the notion of empiricism which is used in many histories of early modern thought does not have early modern, pre-Kantian origins. It first appeared and became widely used in Germany during the last two decades of the eighteenth century, in the course of the early debates on Kant\u2019s Critical philosophy. The paper has seven sections. Section 1 locates the present inquiry within current debates on the historiography of early modern philosophy. Section 2 discusses Francis Bacon\u2019s notions of empirical philosopher, physician, and politician, in order to establish whether Bacon employs or adumbrates the standard historiographical notion of empiricism. Sections 3 to 5 compare the notions of empirical philosopher, physician, and politician that can be found in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century texts, alongside related notions (e.g. \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d) and methodological stances, with the standard notion of empiricism. Having argued that none of those pre-Kantian notions anticipates the standard notion, I locate its origins in Kant\u2019s Critical works and the early debates on his philosophy in late eighteenth-century Germany (Section 6).

Here, to \u03c8 could be to eat an ice cream, and to \u03c6 could be to walk to the ice cream vendor. Adherents of belief\u2010desire explanation, often labelled \u201cHumeans\u201d, standardly assume that appeals to such belief\u2010desire pairs sufficiently explain many human and animal actions, and also that all actions are explainable thus, at least in so far as they are guided by the agent\u2019s intentions. Humeans take their lead from David Hume\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cReason...is only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\u201d In its original context, this passage from the <jats:italic>Treatise</jats:italic> is naturally taken to convey the thesis that mental states subservient to epistemic rationality \u2013 such as beliefs \u2013 are never in themselves sufficient to motivate action. Thus, an appeal to an agent\u2019s beliefs is never in itself sufficient to lay bare her motivations and explain her actions, but must be supplemented by an appeal to \u201cpassions\u201d such as desires. Many philosophers, so\u2010called Anti\u2010Humeans, have sharply disagreed. Some have pointed to certain beliefs with alleged motivational force in isolation from desires, most commonly evaluative beliefs. Others have argued that belief\u2010desire psychology fails to cut up mental space in a way fruitful to action explanation. Instead, only appeals to other types of mental state will adequately explain many types of intentional action.

Political theories argue that we should bypass the question of the justification of moral human rights and start with the question of which norms and principles should be adopted to regulate the practice. Naturalistic theories, by contrast, claim that a convincing answer to the latter question will have to presuppose some answer to the former. An adequate justification of the system of human rights included in the international practice, according to naturalistic approaches, will ultimately have to rely on some appeal to moral human rights. I call this view the \u201cPriority of the Moral over the Political.\u201d In this essay, I argue that the Priority of the Moral is harder to dismiss than political theories of human rights suggest, and that before we can assess the plausibility of these theories, they need to say more in defense of their claim that they can do without this view. I then consider the two main objections that seem to have motivated many philosophers to abandon the naturalistic approach to the justification of human rights in favor of the political one.

In addition to what is generally taken as the anachronistic attribution of \"aesthetic theories\" to any thinker of the eighteenth century, Hume presents the added difficulty that unlike the other founding-fathers of modern philosophical aesthetics, he produced no systematic work on the subject, and certainly nothing comparable to his efforts in epistemology, morals, politics, history, and religion.1 Even interpreting Hume's most definitive expression of his views on aesthetic questions\u00c2\u2014the famous essay \"Of the Standard of Taste\"\u00c2\u2014is fraught with difficulties and, as the diversity of views on the piece demonstrates, only the most confident reader would take it as an unambiguous statement of Hume's position.2 Some have also emphasized Hume's relative neglect of phenomena to which one would expect an aesthetician to be drawn.

H. Auden's mid-career prose poem, \"Caliban to the Audience,\" Caliban describes what happens when, looking for Ariel, the imagination, the audience finds Caliban instead, a disturbing reminder of the begged question of its existence: \"solid flesh,\" as it were, mysteriously linked to the less-than-solid imagination. Like Ariel, Caliban is a ubiquitous presence who refuses to go away. As he reminds the audience at the very beginning of his address, even when it seeks the \"so good, so great, so dead author to stand before the finally lowered curtain ... it is I ... who will always loom thus wretchedly into your confused picture ...\" (CP 422). Auden's poem circles around this begged question of existence as Caliban takes his audience through an impossibly circular, tripartite structure that adroitly performs the same begged question. The address thus \"proceeds\" with recursively interwoven echo and apostrophe: in a dense style of hyperbole and convoluted sentence structure. From the time it was published, the elaborate artifice of the address suggested--and continues to suggest--to most that the poem is about the ultimate artifice and collapse of poetry, especially the imagination required to produce it. As such, and as the last section of Auden's long poem, \"The Sea and The Mirror, A Commentary on Shakespeare's The Tempest,\" Caliban's address does what many argue of Shakespeare's Tempest: it exposes its art as mere artifice. This way of thinking lends itself well to support the view of those who see Auden becoming anti-Romantic at mid-career, turning his genius to undermining poetry and serving as a licensed jester. This way of thinking, however, ignores Auden's genius in using artifice to expose and undermine the anti-Romantic (and anti-aesthetic) style of thinking characterizing Caliban's audience--and Auden's. It ignores Auden's central explanation of the piece, not in terms of what it attempts to represent but in terms of its unusual style performed by an \"inarticulate creature,\" Caliban, who speaks by borrowing from Ariel the \"most artificial style possible\": that of the imagination. (2) Speaking the \"real Word,\" Caliban gets at the ineffable truth of human existence, the existence of \"born actors\" (CP 444). As Edward Mendelson observes, Caliban, in fact, is an \"artifice that embodies everything that is not an artifice.\" (3) Like the imagination for which he speaks, Caliban is an irritating, irrefutable, aesthetic entity impossible to deny or silence. In all of these respects, finally, Caliban plays a highly Romantic role performing, rather than attempting to represent, the sublime, a role this paper will investigate in three, interwoven venues as evidence of Auden's revision of the Romantic sublime. To begin with, as Auden defines it in his study of Romanticism, The Enchafed Flood, the ultimate focus of the Romantic poet, who serves as the subject of his poetry, is his journey into himself. Here he finds an \"unsolved problem,\" perpetually both \"a stating and a solving of the problem.\" (4) He finds the begged question of identity inherent in being human, the indeterminate identity there within the poet's consciousness, privy to his thoughts and feelings. The discontinuity and dialectical tension that mark Caliban's observations in these ways, align him with what M. H. Abrams defines as the \"silent human auditor\" in the greater Romantic lyric. In the tripartite form, that moves from outer to inner and back to outer landscapes, this auditor appears in the inner landscape, the landscape of the poet's thoughts and feelings. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2006-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.2628003E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.984881E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "4.7018498E-4", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A Spiritual Turn in Philosophy"}, {"@classid": "subtitle", "@classname": "subtitle", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Rethinking the Global Significance of Confucian Humanism"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a spiritual turn in philosophy rethinking the global significance of confucian humanism"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>An exposition of the core Confucian text, the Analects, is a rich resource for thinking philosophically about aesthetics, ethics, and religion.

One central class of problems results when one is forced to compare the preservation of life and the avoidance of pain. This is frequently at work in dilemmas about allocation of health care resources. Equally important problems arise when avoidance of human death or pain has to be compared with avoidance of animal death or pain. Some issues involve both of these comparisons, giving a four way tradeoff: human pain, animal pain, human death, animal death. This happens in some issues about animal experimentation, especially when the expected result is to the benefit of animals as well as humans. The purpose of this note is to describe a way in which the first comparison that of pain and death can be used to explore the second that of evils befalling individuals of different species. The basic idea is very simple. Make two assumptions. Assume first that pain is an objective and species-independent evil, that is, that more pain is worse than less pain whoever it is that is suffering, and also that in principle the degree to which a person or animal is suffering is an objective fact. Assume next that the balance between the relative evil of pain and death varies from one species to another, that in one species death may be a worse thing in comparison to pain than in another. It follows that the death of an animal of one species can be compared to that of another, in terms of their different relations to comparable amounts of pain. We can thus use pain as the common currency in comparing rather different evils in different species."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1988-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9208076E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.3530414E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.316217E-5", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Introduction: Kant\u2019s philosophical method and contemporary perspectives in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science and ethics"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "introduction kant s philosophical method and contemporary perspectives in epistemology metaphysics philosophy of mind philosophy of science and ethics"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Introduction: Kant's philosophical method and contemporary perspectives in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science and ethics"}], "abstract": {"$": "n/a"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2021-01-07"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.155773E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Political Theology in the Book of Daniel: An Internal Debate"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "political theology in the book of daniel an internal debate"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p> Because the book of Daniel developed over a period of nearly four hundred years, it is not surprising that it contains some divergent perspectives.

In particular, the theological perspectives on the nature of gentile kingship vary significantly. In several narratives in the book of Daniel, the king humbly confesses the sovereignty of the God of the Jews, acknowledging that he rules by the will of God. Other parts of the book depict the gentile king as being part of God's plan, but a part that will ultimately be destroyed as incompatible with divine sovereignty. The final chapters of the book contain the most negative view of gentile kingship, finding it to be monstrous and utterly evil. Although one can understand the different perspectives based on particular historical circumstances, a more fruitful hermeneutical approach is to read the different perspectives in Daniel as a never-fully-resolved conversation about the good or evil nature of political power, a conversation that continues to this day. </jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2012-12-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "3.2119016E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "8.1002044E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.07776", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Becoming Pluralists: Kant on the Normative Features of Pluralistic Thinking"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "becoming pluralists kant on the normative features of pluralistic thinking"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Kant\u2019s essays in the philosophy of history, such as<jats:italic>Universal History</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Conjectural Beginning</jats:italic>, offer a speculative account of the gradual development of reason in our species and of the way the mature use of reason can be attained.

The complexity of this integration raises the question whether moral perception is inferential and thereby quite different from ordinary perception. This question is answered by clarifying the notion of inference and by pursuing an analogy between moral perception and perception of emotion.

As Pink recognizes, the conventional answer to this question is: \"The same attitudes which explain the performance of the actions decides upon.\" In other words, convention asserts an Identity thesis: an agent's justification at any time t for then deciding to do action A (or deciding not to do A) later is identical with his justification at t for doing A (or not doing A) later.' The Identity thesis is plausible because decisions are about actions we will perform. We decide how we will act, and a decision to act issues in an intention to act. Moreover, what recommends an action to us are reasons to perform it. Thus, in deliberation about which actions to perform, we are considering them in light of the reasons which justify them. When we decide and, thereby, intend to perform A, we explain that decision and intention to do A by a reason for doing A itself. If this were not the case, a reason for deciding to do A which is not a reason to do A would leave an agent intending to do A with no reason to do A. But no rational agent intends to perform an action which he has no reason to perform. Hence, the truth of the Identity thesis. Pink asserts that an implication of the Identity thesis is that a decision, unlike decided upon and intended actions, is not means-end justifiable. Stated differently, our justifications for deciding to do A are not purposes for deciding to do A per se, where deciding to do A itself is required as a means to an end about which we deliberate.

I see no evidence that Hume intended the simple/complex distinction to apply to the dispositions connected with abstract ideas.

One can form a distinct idea of the colour of the apple without forming any idea of taste or smell. The shape of the apple would not be distinct in the same way. Any idea of the shape of the apple would, for Hume, also be an idea of some colour or other. This becomes important when we note that Hume characterizes space and time (indeed, all relations) as complex ideas (T 13). He does not mean that these ideas are logically analyzable; he means that any instance of these ideas is psychologically analyzable. Any instance is analyzable into idea parts that can be considered separately in mind from the other idea parts. An instance ofspace or extension isa complex perception in the sense that it consists of an array of coloured or tangible perceptions, each of which could be considered in isolation from the others. An instance of time is a complex perception in that it consists ofa sequence ofnoticeably different perceptions, each ofwhich could be considered in isolation from the others in the sequence. We must tell an additional story about the abstract ideas (so-called) of space and time, one that requires first some discussion of Hume's general account of abstract ideas. According to Hume an abstract idea is nothing but a particular idea connected with a disposition or custom to bring to mind other particular ideas ofthe same type (T 20-21). So, for example, the abstract idea of triangle is always an idea of some specific triangle or other connected with a disposition to bring to mind ideas of other specific triangles if performing a cognitive task should call for it. Hume's example is having in mind an idea of an equilateral triangle in performing the cognitive task of deciding the truth of the proposition that the three angles of a triangle are equal to each other. If one has an adequate abstract idea of triangle one will bring to mind the instances of scalenum and isoceles that show that the proposition is false (T 21)."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "1990-04-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "5.87816E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.9699211E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "18", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.38515732", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "1", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "The Isomorphism of Space, Time and Matter in Seventeenth-century Natural Philosophy"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "the isomorphism of space time and matter in seventeenth century natural philosophy"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article documents the general tendency of seventeenth-century natural philosophers, irrespective of whether they were atomists or anti-atomists, to regard space, time and matter as magnitudes having the same internal composition.

With this sentence, Fichte raises the question of the realization of the moral law by a plurality of rational beings. He is entitled to raise this question at that particular point of his discussion because, earlier in the same paragraph, he had deduced what has come to be known as \"interpersonality.\" As we know, in order for an individual to recognize herself as a free being, she must necessarily posit the existence of another free rational being. From that point on, the realization of morality becomes a collective task. All rational beings pursue the same end; that is, me absolute independence and self-sufficiency of reason, and in order to attain mis common goal, they should all act in the same way. Fichte stresses this aspect of the collective realization of morality by saying that we should strive toward \"uniformity of acting\" (Gleichformigkeit des Handelns).2 The question is then: How are we to understand Fichte's requirement of uniformity of moral conduct? Since the result of the deduction of intersubjectivity is that the I has to be particularized, that it has to discover itself as an empirical I, the question then arises as to how such an individual I is to relate to the pure rational law and to its universal character. In what follows, I intend to examine this question in Ught of the criticisms that Fichte addresses to the Kantian conception of morality, and, in particular, in Ught of the conception of universality underlying Kant's moral law. In the section where Fichte writes that we should all act in the same manner, he formulates two remarks concerning the way Kant exposes his categorical imperative, two remarks that will retain our attention. As Fichte expressly makes these remarks from his own \"point of view,\"3 they will help us to circumscribe his position on me universaUty of die moral law. But even though he does not agree witii Kant on the exact role of universaUty, Fichte, in 1798, nevertheless accepts the Kantian idea of a unanimous agreement among rational beings, a position that he will later have to qualify. The second part of this essay will focus on Fichte's lectures of 1806, The Way Towards the Blessed Life, in which he introduces me famous distinction between \"lower\" and \"higher\" morality, a distinction that will allow us to determine Fichte's final stand on the \"uniformity of acting,\" the theme he developed in 1798. Once again, Kant will serve here as a guiding thread insofar as he becomes considered, from then on, to be a proponent of the lower level of morality, a morality that aims at nothing other than a uniforming of human conduct. In my final remarks, I shall come back to the System of Ethics of 1798 in order to see in what sense the accusations brought against Kant's ethics in 1806 might also be directed against Fichte's own System of Ethics, as he himself admits. But I shall also try to show that some aspects of the higher morality, namely, the uniqueness of the role each person has to play as well as the creative character of the law, were already somewhat anticipated in 1798, and that despite the evolution that the principles of the Wissenschafislehre went through, the concrete content of Fichte's ethics did not undergo a radical change. Let us start by reading the passage of the System of Ethics in which the sentence stating the necessary uniformity of the actions of all moral subjects is introduced. As has already been said, Fichte comes here to the point where moraUty can be envisaged as a coUective task, as the task of all rational beings: \"As we have seen, the moral final end of every rational being is the self-sufficiency of reason as such, and hence the moraUty of all rational beings. We ought all to act in the same manner.\"4 MoraUty is a task that concerns everyone; hence all rational beings must agree on this common end, on what has to be done. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2008-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "4.6355364E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "Job y la teolog\u00eda tr\u00e1gica de Paul Ricoeur"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "job y la teologia tragica de paul ricoeur"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:crosswalk:repository", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "Job and the tragic theology of Paul Ricoeur"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>Job hace estallar la visi\u00f3n \u00e9tica del mundo.

(2) But what ethical issues will nanotechnology raise that will be novel? How could an ethical approach be novel, and why would that be necessary? Commentators also strongly urge ethical reflection to begin now on all aspects of nanotechnology, including the kind of atom-by-atom manufacturing predicted by optimistic futurists. But what issues call for immediate attention? And given that those responding to these calls would require intellectual and financial resources, does reflection on speculative visions of nanotechnology warrant that expense? We can predict, first, that nanotech innovations will raise serious ethical issues in the present and upcoming decades, and we should be thankful to the commentators for beginning discussion. The unique properties of many nanoparticles and materials that scientists are beginning to exploit raise significant health and environmental concerns. Second, advances in nanomedicine will probably be accompanied by ethical concerns about human enhancement, rising health care costs and rationing, and increasing diagnostic powers. Third, nano-enhanced tracking devices may threaten individual privacy, especially if they become ubiquitous. Finally, nanotechnology will likely raise justice-related concerns about the economic effects of a technological revolution. But we must resist equating new technological powers with novel ethical challenges. These ethical issues are already raised by other technologies, and we would waste resources and forget lessons already learned by unreflectively assuming that nanotechnology requires us to invent a whole new ethics--as if that were possible--with its attendant conferences, journals, centers, and funding mechanisms. Moreover, even if the most radical futuristic visions of nanotechnology are realized, history teaches us that such extreme prophecies should not, at this time, flame debate or warrant ethical attention. There is no settled definition of \"nanotechnology,\" but all the candidates say something about understanding and manipulating matter on the scale of one to one hundred nanometers. However, that criterion alone subsumes much of conventional science and technology, including most chemical reactions. If nanotechnology represents a new field, it should refer to the exploitation of newly discovered laws and properties that nanoparticles uniquely possess, such as their conductivity and quantum effects. Even without a precise definition, nanotechnology holds great promise for human welfare both on its own and through its convergence with other technologies. Nanomedical research already shows signs of that potential. Cancer researchers have successfully tested in mice a nanocell drug delivery system that enables a slow release of antiangiogenesis agents and chemotherapy. (3) DNA nanoparticles have been used to accomplish gene transfer and improve physiological functioning in patient-subjects with cystic fibrosis. (4) Researchers have nanoengineered membrane systems designed to clean water efficiently by targeting pollutants. (5) Other nanotechnologies are likely to produce stronger, lighter materials and faster, more efficient computers. Despite the potential of manipulating matter at the nanoscale, Eric Drexler, nanotechnology's best-known visionary, laments its association with that broadly construed endeavor. (6) On his view, we are losing sight of nanotechnology's truly radical promise--molecular manufacturing--first imagined by Richard Feynman forty-five years ago: \"[I]t would be, in principle, possible (I think) for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down. \u2026"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2007-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "4.518792E-9", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "9.930289E-10", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "20", "@class": "C4"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.041365236", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "10", "@class": "C4"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "A principled and cosmopolitan neuroethics: considerations for international relevance"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@inferred": false, "@provenanceaction": "sysimport:actionset", "@trust": "0.9", "$": "A principled and cosmopolitan neuroethics: considerations for international relevance."}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "a principled and cosmopolitan neuroethics considerations for international relevance"}], "abstract": {"$": "Neuroethics applies cognitive neuroscience for prescribing alterations to conceptions of self and society, and for prescriptively judging the ethical applications of neurotechnologies.

Herein we offer that an objectively principled neuroethics for international relevance requires a new meta-ethics: understanding how morality works, and how humans manage and improve morality, as objectively based on the brain and social sciences.

A metaphysical question, surely, both in having been discussed by metaphysicians (recent example: Milov Arsenijevid [1]) and also in the unfortunate characteristic that the hardest part of answering the question is understanding it. Suppose we understand the question in the sense a physicist would find natural. Then the answer seems to be straightforwardly negative, for reasons having to do with the atomic composition of matter and the vagaries of quantum mechanics. The conceptual question that metaphysicians ask involves a more abstract notion of possibility. Well, then, is it logically possible, suspending the laws of physics and making arbitrary hypotheses about the nature of matter? Hypothesize that matter is homogeneous, exactly filling regions of Euclidean space, and that the laws of nature allow differential interaction with any solid, understanding a physical solid as the material content of a geometrical solid in the sense of Tarski [4]. Then the positive answer follows immediately: that a brick, or any other regular open point-set, divides into infinitely many disjoint regular open point-sets is a mathematical triviality. But that is too easy. Are there hypotheses, about the composition of matter and the laws of physics, which aren't too far-fetched, and allow us to make sense of the notion of a brick with infinitely many physically distinguishable layers? But how are we to understand far-fetchedness? Allowable hypotheses should be recognizable as not-too-extreme generalizations and modifications of actual physics: cf. David Lewis's discussion of Quine's construction of ersatz possible worlds in the 'Foundations' chapter of [3]. But what is too extreme? What we want is a hypothesis such that a world satisfying it would permit observations analogous to and only observations analogous to the sorts of observations on which our actual knowledge of the physical world is based, hypotheses that, so to speak, change only the empirical details of the world, but leave the phenomenology of our physical knowledge as it is.

Perceivers are immediately aware of nothing but sensory ideas in the mind; yet perceivers think of real external substances that correspond to and cause those ideas, and they are warranted in believing that those substances exist (at that time). The theory poses two questions: what warrants the truth of such beliefs? What is it in virtue of which sensory ideas represent external objects and how do they make perceivers think of those objects? Both the epistemic and semantic issues need to be addressed. This paper urges that Locke's basic account of warrant is roughly reliabilist. The causal origin of sensory ideas assures that, in general, sense based beliefs are true. Locke defines the limit of this warrant by the theoretical point that we cannot discuss skeptical doubt without assuming the truthfulness of our perceptual faculty. Turning to the semantic question, the paper argues that ideas are mental modifications or entities. They are not intrinsically representative (satisfiable), but rather represent only by virtue of their causal origin. They merely \u201ctrack\u201d the presence of substances and their qualities. Ideas nevertheless prompt perceivers to think of their causes. This is roughly because sensory ideas have a specific mental role, namely, to serve as marks for distinguishing substances and their respective qualities for purposes of action. The paper suggests that, for Locke, the challenge posed by the semantic veil of ideas is to explain this externally directed marking function within bounds of his anti\u2010innatism.

I argue here that, in fact, both Barth and Marion appeal to revelation in an attempt to respond to a tendency within philosophy to coerce thought. Philosophy, when it claims to be able to access a universal, absolute truth within history, degenerates into ideology. By making conceptually possible some \u201aevental\u2019 phenomena that always evade <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> epistemic conditions, Barth\u2019s and Marion\u2019s theories of revelation relativize all philosophical knowledge, rendering any ideological claim to absolute truth impossible. The difference between their two theories, then, lies in how they understand the relationship between philosophy and theology. For Barth, philosophy\u2019s attempts to make itself absolute is a produce of sinful human vanity; its corrective is thus an authentic revealed theology, which Barth articulates in Christian, dogmatic terms. Marion, on the other hand, equipped with Heidegger\u2019s critique of ontotheology, highlights one specific kind of philosophizing\u2014metaphysics\u2014as generative of ideology. To counter metaphysics, Marion draws heavily on Barth\u2019s account of revelation but secularizes it, reinterpreting the \u201aevent\u2019 as the saturated phenomenon. Revelation\u2019s unpredictability is thus preserved within Marion\u2019s philosophy, but is no longer restricted to the appearing of God. Both understandings of revelation achieve the same epistemological result, however. Reality can never be rendered transparent to thought; within history, all truth is provisional. A concept of revelation drawn originally from Christian theology thus, counterintuitively, is what secures philosophy\u2019s right to challenge and critique the pre-given, a hermeneutic freedom I suggest is the meaning of <jats:italic>sola scriptura</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2019-01-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.841867E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "1.6261971E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "0.0", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "El m\u00e9todo de la cognici\u00f3n incorporada / The method embodied cognition"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "el metodo de la cognicion incorporada the method embodied cognition"}], "abstract": {"$": "<jats:p>&lt;p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;\" align=\"justify\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: serif;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"&gt;La cognici\u00f3n incorporada entra en la visi\u00f3n epistemol\u00f3gica del realismo m\u00ednimo, es decir de c\u00f3mo es el mundo independientemente de nosotros.

As he continued to contemplate Sun Yat Sen's political testament first articulated in a 1923 speech as \"Three Principles of the People,\" Kaplan moved deftly from questions of power toward religious aims. \"To attain this goal\" of freedom and equality, he wrote, \"we must bring about a thorough awakening of our own people and ally ourselves in a common struggle with all individuals and groups that labor to bring self-determination and self-fulfillment within reach of all human beings.\"1 Kaplan's reflection on the famous Chinese nationalist leader's ideas oc curred at a moment when Nazis were rounding up Jews in Poland and forcing them into ghettos. The Nazi assault on Jews had just begun (the German conquest of western Europe would not start until the spring), but Kaplan was well aware of Nazism's identification of democracy as a degenerate political form with Jews as a degenerate race. At this vulner able moment for Jews, Kaplan pondered the importance of allies in a struggle for self-determination and self-fulfillment\u2014the first a national political goal and the second an individual religious one\u2014for all men and women. While his political consciousness remained firmly wedded to his religious commitment, Kaplan was no parochial Jewish thinker. He was always willing to seek inspiration from diverse non-Jewish sources and to adapt ideas to fulfill his goals of reviving Judaism and the Jewish people in the modern world."}, "dateofAcceptance": {"$": "2009-12-01"}, "metrics": [{"@id": "influence", "@score": "2.9187226E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity", "@score": "2.426342E-9", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "influence_alt", "@score": "2", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "popularity_alt", "@score": "1.216", "@class": "C5"}, {"@id": "impulse", "@score": "0", "@class": "C5"}]}, {"title": [{"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "All the Right Responses: Fiction Films and Warranted Emotions"}, {"@classid": "main title", "@classname": "main title", "@schemeid": "dnet:dataCite_title", "@schemename": "dnet:dataCite_title", "$": "all the right responses fiction films and warranted emotions"}], "abstract": {"$": "Cognitive theories of emotions have provided us with explanations of how we emotionally engage with fiction, when we are aware that what is depicted is fictional.
