The current study was conducted in the hyporheic zone (HZ) at the Hanford Site of the U.S. Department of Energy, which has been known for its highly heterogeneous sediments and transient hydrodynamics. Distributions of hydraulic conductivity and sediment-associated Fe concentration were averaged at a group of SRs, while measured hourly water levels were further moving averaged at daily and monthly TRs. Fe concentration is selected for assembling geochemical heterogeneity due to its important role in redox transformation of Cr at the site. Three Fe distributions, with Fe concentrated on small, medium, and large sediment grains, respectively, were also considered. A series of flow and reactive transport simulations configured with different combinations of SRs, TRs, and Fe distributions were conducted. Simulated results revealed that Cr(VI) discharged to river is underestimated if SR decreases. For both the hydrodynamics and the discharge of Cr(VI) to river, difference caused by SR can be amplified with the decrease of TR. Biogeochemical transformation of Cr is more dependent on SR while hydrodynamics is on TR. The stronger control of SR than TR on biogeochemical transformation of Cr is resulted from more sensitive increase of Fe(II) with decreasing SR than with decreasing TR. Effect of SR is highly sensitive to variations of SR with Fe on medium-size grains while is persistent to a much smaller SR with Fe on small-size grains.

The elimination of closed depressions by filling implicitly assumes that all depressions are caused by elevation underestimation. This assumption is difficult to support, as depressions can be produced by overestimation as well as by underestimation of DEM values.This paper presents a new algorithm that is applied in conjunction with conventional depression filling to provide a more realistic treatment of those depressions that are likely due to overestimation errors. The algorithm lowers the elevation of selected cells on the edge of closed depressions to simulate breaching of the depression outlets. Application of this breaching algorithm prior to depression filling can substantially reduce the number and size of depressions that need to be filled, especially in low relief terrain.Removing or reducing the size of a depression by breaching implicitly assumes that the depression is due to a spurious flow blockage caused by elevation overestimation. Removing a depression by filling, on the other hand, implicitly assumes that the depression is a direct artifact of elevation underestimation. Although the breaching algorithm cannot distinguish between overestimation and underestimation errors in a DEM, a constraining parameter for breaching length can be used to restrict breaching to closed depressions caused by narrow blockages along well-defined drainage courses. These are considered the depressions most likely to have arisen from overestimation errors. Applying the constrained breaching algorithm prior to a conventional depression-filling algorithm allows both positive and negative elevation adjustments to be used to remove depressions.The breaching algorithm was incorporated into the DEM pre-processing operations of the TOPAZ software system. The effect of the algorithm is illustrated by the application of TOPAZ to a DEM of a low-relief landscape. The use of the breaching algorithm during DEM pre-processing substantially reduced the number of cells that needed to be subsequently raised in elevation to remove depressions. The number and kind of depression cells that were eliminated by the breaching algorithm suggested that the algorithm effectively targeted those topographic situations for which it was intended. A detailed inspection of a portion of the DEM that was processed using breaching algorithm in conjunction with depression-filling also suggested the effects of the algorithm were as intended.The breaching algorithm provides an empirically satisfactory and robust approach to treating closed depressions in a raster DEM. It recognises that depressions in certain topographic settings are as likely to be due to elevation overestimation as to elevation underestimation errors. The algorithm allows a more realistic treatment of depressions in these situations than conventional methods that rely solely on depression-filling.'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '1999-08-01'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '1.6446858E-8', '@class': 'C3'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '3.0306964E-8', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '140', '@class': 'C3'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '8.8266115', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '6', '@class': 'C4'}]}\n",

This study proposes a new two-stage surrogate-assisted Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based Bayesian framework to identify contaminant source parameters for groundwater polluted by dense nonaqueous phase liquid. In the framework, an adaptive update feedback process is proposed to construct a locally accurate surrogate model over posterior distributions to replace the time-consuming multiphase flow model. To increase the efficiency of the MCMC simulation, a multiobjective feasibility-enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOFEPSO) is adopted to generate the initial guess of the contamination source parameters. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are confirmed via a synthetic study. The contaminant source parameters generated by the proposed approach are compared with those computed by the one-stage surrogate-assisted MCMC-based Bayesian approach. The results demonstrate that the root mean squared error (RMSE) between true value of parameters and maximum a-posteriori density values (MAP) obtained by the proposed method decreased by 71.3% compared with those obtained by one-stage surrogate-based framework. To further assess the efficiency of MOFEPSO, the same inversion problem is solved with random values as the initial guesses of the unknown parameters during MCMC simulation; the other conditions are the same as the proposed framework. The results indicate that adopting MOFEPSO improves the efficiency of MCMC simulation. Therefore, the proposed approach can accurately and effectively identify the contaminant source parameters with achieving about 148 times of speed-up compared to the simulation-based MCMC simulation.'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '2021-03-01'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '3.545663E-9', '@class': 'C5'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '2.341957E-8', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '22', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '14.336', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '22', '@class': 'C4'}]}\n",

Despite the importance of ET in aiding a rain garden to recover void space during the time between storm events, it is not often measured or calculated because it is so difficult to do so. This paper explores the use of soil moisture sensors to estimate ET, since they are relatively inexpensive to purchase and install. Three rain garden weighing lysimeters in Villanova, PA, were used for this study. Over a 3‐yr study period daily ET was calculated each dry day and summed during the time in between storm events &gt;25\\xa0mm. The cumulative changes of soil moisture readings during the interevent time at three depths were compared with the concurrent cumulative changes in the lysimeter weight readings. Cumulative soil moisture change was found to be strongly correlated to the cumulative ET for the different lysimeter media and drainage types. Using the two soil moisture sensors at the top and bottom of the soil column provided a similar result to using all soil moisture reading depths. The best single soil moisture reading depth was at the bottom of the lysimeter.

The inputs of the BN are monthly inflows, reservoir storages at the beginning of the month, and downstream water demands. The trained BN provides the probability distribution functions of reservoirs' releases for each set of input data. The long-term optimization model in monthly scale is formulated to minimize the expected flood and agricultural water deficit damages. The optimization model is developed using an extended version of the Varying chromosome Length Genetic Algorithm (VLGA-II). To incorporate reservoir preparedness for controlling the probable floods in each month, damages associated with floods with different return periods have been considered in the optimization model. For this purpose, a short-term optimization model which provides the optimal hourly releases during floods is utilized and linked to a flood damage estimation model. Damages due to deficit in supplying agricultural water demands are also calculated based on the functions of crop yield responses to deficit irrigation. The developed models are applied to the cascade system of the Dez and Bakhtiari Reservoirs in Southwest of Iran. The result of the trained BN is compared with the rules developed using classical and fuzzy linear regressions and it is shown that the total damage obtained by the BN-based operating rules is about 60 percent less than the total damage obtained using the fuzzy and classical regression analyses.

These problems will remain or even worsen in the following decades, threatening regional eco-environmental quality and socio-economic development. Mitigation of these problems through integrated water resources and farmland management (WRFM) is desired but is challenged by multiple system complexities, e.g. interrelations of diverse system components. To fill this gap, an interval fuzzy water resources and farmland programming (IFWRFP) approach is developed in this study for eliminating the potential problems in the SHRW, leading to increased reliability of the decision support process. A series of systematic WRFM measures are proposed for enabling harmonious development of ecological environment and social economy in the SHRW. For instance, planting should always be the priority due to the major contribution of agriculture to the regional economy. As the primary commercial crop, rice cultivation should be allocated the most irrigation water, followed by corn, potato and soybean. Potato yield should be increased to compensate for reduced productivity of the other crops since 2019. It is also revealed that economic benefits are proportional to water environmental pollution in the SHRW. Therefore, decision-makers should adopt the most reasonable suggested schemes after fully balancing the trade-off of environment and economy. Most importantly, a variety of supporting policies are required for enabling sufficient implementation of these measures across the SHRW. For instance, individual farmers can be encouraged to follow the overall crop cultivation plan by the alteration of subsidiaries, taxes, and prices on crop-related activities. The modeling solutions show that the IFWRFP approach can systematically optimize allocations of water resources and cultivation patterns and thus potentially eliminate the problems of water scarcity, water contamination, and soil erosion in the SHRW.'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '2018-08-08'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '3.7376227E-9', '@class': 'C5'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '1.3920475E-8', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '15', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '6.535616', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '6', '@class': 'C4'}]}\n",

Studies of schematized confluences with a step at the interface between the tributary and the main channel bed reveal that bed elevation discordance is an important additional control for the confluence hydrodynamics. This study aimed to improve understanding of the influence of bed elevation discordance on the flow patterns and head losses in a right-angled confluence of an open channel with rectangular cross-sections. A large eddy simulation (LES)-based numerical model was set up and validated with experiments by others. Four configurations with different bed discordance ratios were investigated. The results confirm that, with increasing bed elevation discordance, the tributary streamlines at the confluence interface deviate less from the geometrical confluence angle, the extent of the recirculation zone (RZ) gets smaller, the ratio of the water depth upstream to that downstream of the confluence decreases, and the water level depression reduces. The bed elevation discordance also leads to the development of a large-scale structure in the lee of the step. Despite the appearance of the large-scale structure, the reduced extent of the RZ and associated changes in flow deflection/contraction reduce total head losses experienced by the main channel with an increase of the bed discordance ratio. It turns out that bed elevation discordance converts the lateral momentum from the tributary to streamwise momentum in the main channel more efficiently.

This paper presents a numerical evaluation of the randomness which can be observed in the geometry of major river channels. The method used is based upon that of generating a Sierpinski triangle via the chaos game technique, played with the sequence representing the river topography. The property of the Sierpinski triangle is that it can be constructed only by playing a chaos game with random values. Periodic or chaotic sequences always produce an incomplete triangle. The quantitative data about the scale of the random behaviour of the river channel pathway was evaluated by determination of the completeness of the triangle, generated on the basis of sequences representing the river channel, and measured by its fractal dimension. The results show that the most random behaviour is observed for the Danube River when sampled every 715 m. By comparing the maximum dimension of the obtained Sierpinski triangle with the gradient of the river we can see a strong correlation between a higher gradient corresponding to lower random behaviour. Another connection can be seen when comparing the length of the segment where the river shows the most random flow with the total length of the river. The shorter the river, the denser the sampling rate of observations has to be in order to obtain a maximum degree of randomness. From the comparison of natural rivers with the computer-generated pathways the most similar results have been produced by a complex superposition of different sine waves. By adding a small amount of noise to this function, the fractal dimensions of the generated complex curves are the most similar to the natural ones, but the general shape of the natural curve is more similar to the generated complex one without the noise.                     </jats:p>'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '2009-06-23'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '4.33528E-9', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '1.6027776E-9', '@class': 'C5'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '3', '@class': 'C5'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '0.22738376', '@class': 'C5'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '1', '@class': 'C5'}]}\n",

The objective of this work is to study the change of the soil air permeability during continuous venting and removal of contaminant from a polluted soil. SVE pilot experiments were conducted to investigate the interaction of soil air permeability with total liquids saturation. Oppositely to previous studies, air permeability was measured by fitting pressure data measured in a 3D laboratory venting pilot to an analytical airflow solution. The experimental correlation was compared with two different correlations published previously. A difference was observed between measured and calculated air relative air permeabilities especially for low water saturation degrees. The importance of the correct estimate of relative permeability was then illustrated by comparing vacuums and streamlines calculated using measured permeability and permeability values estimated with the two correlations tested here. Results show that an inappropriate assessment of relative permeability may engender significant errors in designing an SVE system. The second part of this work reports on the influence of air permeability change on the prediction capability of an SVE mathematical model. A significant difference between simulated breakthrough curves, estimated using firstly the relationship established experimentally and secondly the two other correlations, was observed.

Stream temperature is an important indicator for biodiversity and sustainability in aquatic ecosystems. The stream temperature model currently in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) only considers the impact of air temperature on stream temperature, while the hydroclimatological stream temperature model developed within SWAT model considers hydrology and the impact of air temperature in simulating the water-air heat transfer process. In this study we propose using the equilibrium temperature approach to model complex heat transfer processes at the water-air interface, which reflects the influences of air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and stream water depth on the heat transfer process. The thermal capacity of the streamflow is modelled by the variation of the stream water depth. An advantage of this equilibrium temperature model is the simple parameterization, with only two added parameters to model the heat transfer processes. The equilibrium temperature model is applied and tested in the Athabasca River Basin (ARB) in Alberta, Canada. The model is calibrated and validated at five stations throughout different parts of the ARB for which high-frequency observed stream temperature data are available. The results indicate that the equilibrium temperature model provided better and more consistent performances for the different regions of the ARB with the values of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (&gt;\\u20090.67) greater than those of the original SWAT model and the hydroclimatological model. Overall, the equilibrium temperature model uses existing SWAT meteorological data as input, can be calibrated using fewer parameters and less effort, and has an overall better performance for the simulation of daily stream temperatures. Thus, it can be used as an effective tool for predicting the change in stream temperature regimes under varying hydrological and meteorological conditions. In addition, the impact of the stream temperature simulations on chemical reaction rates and concentrations was tested. The results indicate that the improved performance of the stream temperature simulation could significantly affect chemical reaction rates and the simulated concentrations and the equilibrium temperature model could be a potential tool to model stream temperature for water quality simulations.                         </jats:p>'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '2017-07-25'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '4.0079278E-9', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '1.2292801E-8', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '28', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '7.916032', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '18', '@class': 'C4'}]}\n",

Instead, it was the intensity of the vertical inflow events and the local recharge rate that were found to exert an impact on the spatiotemporal variation of the aquifer response times. It was assumed that large amounts of vertical inflow increase the soil's volumetric water content above the water table, leading to higher values of hydraulic conductivity of  unsaturated soils , thus contributing to shortening aquifer response times.

Monte Carlo (MC) methods have been widely used in uncertainty analysis and parameter identification for hydrological models. The main challenge with these approaches is, however, the prohibitive number of model runs required to get an adequate sample size which may take from days to months especially when the simulations are run in distributed mode. In the past, emulators have been used to minimize the computational burden of the MC simulation through direct estimation of the residual based response surfaces. Here, we apply emulators of MC simulation in parameter identification for a distributed conceptual hydrological model using two likelihood measures, i.e. the absolute bias of model predictions (Score) and another based on the time relaxed limits of acceptability concept (pLoA). Three machine learning models (MLMs) were built using model parameter sets and response surfaces with limited number of model realizations (4000). The developed MLMs were applied to predict pLoA and Score for a large set of model parameters (95\\u2009000). The behavioural parameter sets were identified using a time relaxed limits of acceptability approach based on the predicted pLoA values; and applied to estimate the quantile streamflow predictions weighted by their respective Score. The three MLMs were able to adequately mimic the response surfaces directly estimated from MC simulations; and the models identified using the coupled ML emulators and the limits of acceptability approach have performed very well in reproducing the median streamflow prediction both during the calibration and validation periods.                         </jats:p>'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '2019-10-07'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '3.2591565E-9', '@class': 'C5'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '1.2974053E-8', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '15', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '5.4064', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '11', '@class': 'C4'}]}\n",

However, recent investigations of quality of aquatic habitat at the stream segment scale, at hundredth of metre resolution macrohabitat, indicate that the spatial distribution of aquatic habitat quality and size is an important factor at the network scale. Here, we hypothesize that aquatic habitat connectivity, quality and patch size are also important at the microhabitat scale. We test this hypothesis by modelling Chinook salmon (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</jats:italic>) spawning habitat in a 6‐km long reach of Bear Valley Creek (Idaho, USA) with microhabitat resolution of 1‐m square. We use two‐dimensional hydraulic numerical modelling coupled with suitability curves to predict the spatial distribution of spawning habitat quality. We quantify connectivity for each habitat patch with the ratio between the area of neighbouring patches and their squared hydrographic distances. Results from a logistic regression analysis comparing predicted with observed spawning locations indicate that habitat quality and patch size are important factors and connectivity among patches may have a secondary effect. Therefore, spatial distribution of aquatic habitat and size of habitat patches are important aspects of its quality, suggesting that composite metrics such as weighted usable area may not be sufficient in defining the condition of the river environment.

Commonly implemented numerical models are of the shock fitting type that tracks the location of a pipe filling bore. However, the flow regime transition does not have to occur through a pipe filling bore. Another possibility involves a free surface bore with a following gradual transition to a full pipe condition. Large air volumes may be trapped in this situation following the bore reflection off a tunnel transition if this reflection closes the flow cross-section. Experimental observations are presented to demonstrate both types of flow regime transition. Traditional shock fitting methods are ill-equipped to accurately simulate gradual flow regime transitions.

The US Nature Conservancy developed a method known as the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration, IHA (Richter et al. 1996, 1997, 1998), for assessing the degree of hydrological alteration attributable to human induced changes within an ecosystem. The method is based on the statistical analyses of 33 hydrological parameters representing five streamflow characteristics that can be attributed to playing major roles in determining the nature of aquatic and riparian ecosystems (Richter et al. 1996, 1997, 1998). The Range of Variability Approach, RVA, is an application of the IHA, incorporating the concepts of hydrological variability and river ecosystem integrity, and was developed to enable river managers to define and adopt preliminary flow management targets before conclusive, long-term ecosystem research results are available. This paper presents an application of the RVA to simulated streamflows at two of the four Instream Flow Requirements (IFR) Sites on the Mkomazi River in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in order to assess the extent of alteration caused by human induced changes to the hydrological regime. The assessment was achieved by comparing the range of variation of the hydrological regime simulated under natural catchment conditions (pre-impact) with the variation resulting from catchment development (post-impact). The 25th and 75th percentile values of each of the 33 parameters were selected as the lower and upper thresholds within which streamflow management targets could be set. By setting preliminary streamflow management thresholds that can be modified and refined when ecological data and information become available, the RVA incorporates flexibility and adaptability.

It is shown that groundwater affects surface water flow, nutrients and temperature, and can both propagate stressors towards surface waters and buffer the effect of stressors in space and time. The effect of groundwater on drivers and states depends on catchment characteristics, stressor combinations, scale and management practises. The proposed framework shows how groundwater in lowland catchments acts as a bridge between stressors and their effects within surface waters. It shows water managers how their management areas might be influenced by groundwater, and helps them to include this important, but often overlooked part of the water cycle in their basin management plans.

The temporal and spatial dynamics of streamflow presence and absence is considered vital information to many hydrological and ecological studies. Measuring the duration of active streamflow and dry periods in the channel allows us to classify the degree of intermittency of streams. We used different sensing techniques including time-lapse imagery, electric conductivity and stage measurements to generate a combined dataset of presence and absence of streamflow within various nested sub-catchments in the Attert Catchment, Luxembourg. The first sites of observation were established in 2013 and successively extended to a total number of 182 in 2016 as part of the project “Catchments As Organized Systems” (CAOS). Temporal resolution ranged from 5 to 15 minutes intervals. Each single dataset was carefully processed and quality controlled before the time interval was homogenised to 30 minutes. The dataset provides valuable information of the dynamics of a meso-scale stream network in space and time. This can be used to test and evaluate hydrologic models, but also for the assessment of the intermittent stream ecosystem in the Attert basin.

The water balance (1996–2002) shows average annual rainfall of 1640 mm producing annual runoff of 440 mm (baseflow 326 mm, stormflow 114 mm) and ‘deep seepage’ loss of 450 mm (i.e. 450 mm of water not appearing in the stream). Oxygen‐18 (<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O) concentrations were measured at weekly intervals for 8–15 months at six sites, ranging from Pukemanga Stream baseflow through wetland seepage to ephemeral streams and surface runoff. The first two showed no significant <jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O variations. Inferred mean residence times within the catchment ranged from at least 4 years (for the stream baseflow and seepage) to a few weeks (for the ephemeral flows and surface runoff). Silica concentrations could also be used to distinguish deep flowpath water from near‐surface flowpath water. Tritium concentrations gave an estimated mean residence time of 9 years for Pukemanga Stream baseflow. Sulphur hexafluoride tended to give younger ages, while the chlorofluorocarbon ages were older, but are not considered as reliable for dating streamflow in this time range. These results show that deep pathways predominate with over 74% of runoff deriving from deep hillslope flowpaths via the wetland, and 87% of total drainage (baseflow and deep seepage) travelling via deep hillslope flowpaths. Our conception of the deep drainage process is that there is a large volume of slowly moving water in the system (above and below the water table), which reaches the wetland and stream via an unconfined groundwater system. Subsurface water equivalents are estimated to be 2·9 m for drainage at the weir and 4·1 m for drainage bypassing the weir, giving a total of 7 m depth over the catchment. The unsaturated zone plays an important role in storing water for long periods (about 4 years), while linking the surface with the groundwater water table to contribute to the fast streamflow response to rainfall. A schematic model of the various pathways with indicative residence times is given.

Air valves are generally used in pressurized water pipes to manage the air inside them. Under certain circumstances, they can be used as an indirect control mechanism of the hydraulic transient. Unfortunately, one of the major limitations is the reliability of information provided by manufacturers and vendors, which is why experimental trials are usually used to characterize such devices. The realization of these tests is not simple since they require an enormous volume of previously stored air to be used in such experiments. Additionally, the costs are expensive. Consequently, it is necessary to develop models that represent the behaviour of these devices. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques cannot completely replace measurements, the amount of experimentation and the overall cost can be reduced significantly. This work approaches the characterization of air valves using CFD techniques, including some experimental tests to calibrate and validate the results. A mesh convergence analysis was made. The results show how the CFD models are an efficient alternative to represent the behavior of air valves during the entry and exit of air to the system, implying a better knowledge of the system to improve it.</jats:p>'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '2018-10-12'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '4.752283E-9', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '1.6740216E-8', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '18', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '9.22496', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '6', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'downloads', '@score': '248', '@datasource': 'opendoar____::3a20f62a0af1aa152670bab3c602feed||RiuNet'}, {'@id': 'views', '@score': '71', '@datasource': 'opendoar____::3a20f62a0af1aa152670bab3c602feed||RiuNet'}]}\n",

Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is one of the most widely planted species in the semi-arid Loess Plateau, China. The effects of its water use on stand soil water storage (S) and its water use strategy raised much concern due to soil water depletion and its growth degradation. In this study, meteorological factors, soil water content (SWC), ET components and net primary productivity (NPP) were observed in a black locust plantation during a drier (2015) and a wetter (2016) growing season. ET was 160.0\\u202fmm in 2015 and 255.0\\u202fmm in 2016, which accounted for 104.1% and 68.6% of the precipitation (P), respectively. Soil evaporation (E) accounted for the majority of ET (45.4–69.4% at monthly scale), while transpiration (T) was the smallest component of ET (9.7–28.8%). These results showed that it is E that consumed more soil water rather than T in the black locust plantation. E should be carefully considered and improved in predicting or modeling water budgets (e.g. soil water, ET partitioning and runoff) in the reforested catchments in this area. Additionally, the monthly T/ET decreased with P increasing, suggesting that black locusts could transpire water more effectively to survive under drier conditions with less P. Our study can not only improve the understanding of water budget in the reforested catchment in the semi-arid Loess Plateau but also provide the significant evidences of investigating the plant water use strategy from the point of ET partitioning.'}, 'dateofAcceptance': {'$': '2018-09-01'}, 'metrics': [{'@id': 'influence', '@score': '3.8715244E-9', '@class': 'C5'}, {'@id': 'popularity', '@score': '2.8764665E-8', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'influence_alt', '@score': '37', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'popularity_alt', '@score': '16.55648', '@class': 'C4'}, {'@id': 'impulse', '@score': '16', '@class': 'C4'}]}\n",

In the event of a release, a thorough understanding of solute transport within the saturated zone is necessary to predict plume fate and the potential impacts on peatland ecosystems. To better characterize contaminant transport in these systems, approximately 13,000\\xa0L/day of sodium chloride tracer (200\\xa0mg/L) was released into a bog in the James Bay Lowland. The tracer was pumped into a fully penetrating well (1.5\\xa0m) between July 5 and August 18, 2015. Horizontal and vertical plume development was measured via in situ specific conductance and water table depth from an adaptive monitoring network. Over the spill period, the bulk of the plume travelled a lateral distance of 100\\xa0m in the direction of the slight regional groundwater and topographical slope. The plume shape was irregular and followed the hollows, indicating preferential flow paths due to the site microtopography. Saturated transport of the tracer occurred primarily at ~25\\xa0cm below ground surface (bgs), and at a discontinuous high hydraulic conductivity layer ~125\\xa0cm bgs due to a complex and heterogeneous vertical hydraulic conductivity profile. Plume measurement was confounded by a large amount of precipitation (233\\xa0mm over the study period) that temporarily diluted the tracer in the highly conductive upper peat layer. Longitudinal solute advection can be approximated using local water table information (i.e., depth and gradient); microtopography; and meteorological conditions. Vertical distribution of solute within the peat profile is far more complex due to the heterogeneous subsurface; characterization would be aided by a detailed understanding of the site‐specific peat profile; the degree of decomposition; and the type of contaminant (e.g., reactive/nonreactive).

Weekly data for a study period of 2–4 years are provided to (1) describe the seasonal variations in streamwater chemistry, (2) analyse the relationship between stream discharge and solute concentrations using a two-component mixing model and (3) search for patterns of temporal variation in stream solute concentrations after discounting the effects of discharge. At Prades, concentrations of all analysed ions, except NO −  3 , showed marked seasonal variations in stream water, whereas at Montseny only ions related to mineral weathering (HCO −  3 , Na + , Ca 2+  and Mg 2+ ) showed strong seasonality. Ion concentrations were more closely dependent on instantaneous discharge at Montseny than at Prades. The residuals of the relationship between solute concentrations and discharge retained a strong seasonality at Prades, but not at Montseny. These differences are related to the major hydrochemical processes that determine the streamwater chemistry at each site. The same processes are probably operative in the three catchments, but are of varying relative importance. At Montseny, the mixing of waters of different chemical composition seems to be the major process controlling streamwater chemistry, although the soilwater end-member composition predicted by the mixing model applied did not match the measured soilwater chemistry. In the drier Prades catchments, the two major hydrochemical processes determining the seasonal variation of streamwater chemistry are (1) the restart of flow after the summer drought, which flushes out the solutes accumulated during the dry period, and (2) the seasonal changes in groundwater chemistry that result from the interplay of water residence time, temperature and CO 2  partial pressure.

For a gauged basin, a three parameter recession model is employed to estimate the recession time, from day‐to‐day, as flow recedes from mean flow using previously measured site recession curves and a library of recession curve shapes generated by the RObust Parameter Estimation algorithm. The model is tested using data from 10 New Zealand basins which are diverse in low flow hydrological behavior and yields a Median Absolute Error (MAE) of 1 day. Another new model is also developed to predict recession time in an ungauged basin using catchment characteristics and information from master recession curves in a suite of 10 reference basins geologically and hydrologically similar to the ungauged basin, as assessed by a Random Forest model. Model performance is robust with a MAE of 1 day and the models advance the use of past flow records to enable more accurate predictions to be obtained.
